## Annotation

Before you is the famous book "A Clockwork Orange", a manifesto of nonconformists from all over the world; a book that needs no introduction.

This translation of the book, done by Evgeny Sinelshchikov, was first published in the magazine "Youth" and is rightfully considered one of the best.

# Anthony Burgess,  
A Clockwork Orange  
(magazine version)  
From the translator  

One of the most talented and original English writers, Anthony Burgess, is rightly considered a successor to George Orwell's futurist tradition. A Clockwork Orange—based on which renowned American director Stanley Kubrick directed one of the most celebrated films in world cinema, starring the magnificent Malcolm McDowell as the cynical and cruel antihero Alex—is a multifaceted work, combining a philosophical and ethical treatise, an allegorical parable, a phantasmagoria imbued with black humor, and a caustic satire on modern totalitarian society, which seeks, through inhumane methods, to turn the younger generation into a basket of obedient "mechanical oranges" that can be manipulated at will (as we witnessed in the actions of the Red Guards, the Red Brigades, the Khmer Rouge, the neo-fascists, and others). In our country, too, the backbone of any extremist movements and protests is made up of young people manipulated by other, more powerful forces. The action of "A Clockwork Orange" takes place at the turn of the new millennium. Thirty years ago, Burgess anticipated and masterfully captured many of the processes unfolding in our contemporary society, and not just among young people. The analogies are so obvious that they determined my approach to translation. Like Burgess, who, incidentally, came to literature from the world of music and created a new language for the youth of the future, whose structure, according to the author, should be dominated by Slavic-Gypsy roots, I attempted to convey the "Nadsad" language of Russian teenagers—a mixture of youth slang from the 1960s to the late 1980s, dominated by words of English origin (which, incidentally, is a consistent trend in the linguistic development taking place in our society). This proved an immeasurably more difficult task. How I accomplished it is for the reader to judge. I dedicate this work to the “lost generation” of the last (?) perestroika.

# Part I  

"I'm so bored! I feel like howling. What should I do?"

This is me, Alex, and those three bastards are my friends: Pete, Georgie (aka Josh) and Kir (Kirill the moron).

We're sitting at the Korovyaka milk bar, drinking, talking, tinkling, trying to find something to soak up so this beautiful frosty evening doesn't go to waste. Korovyaka is our usual hangout—a place like any other, no better or worse than any other. Like everywhere else, they serve amazing synthetic milk, saturated with an invisible white powder that the cops and other smart alecks from the inspection commissions will never recognize as dope unless they try it themselves. But they prefer whiskey and vodka under the covers...

The signature cow drink is truly delicious. After each drink, for about fifteen minutes you can see the diamond-studded sky, where God is having sex with his angels, and the saints are fighting, deciding which of them will be the Virgin Mary today…

My friends and I are just finishing up our fourth piston. Our pockets are full of money, so our usual idea of head-banging or cutting off some sugar daddy and watching him squirm in a puddle of his own blood and yuri while we pick his pockets is out. Also, don't pay a visit to some old Jewish woman in her shop and sit her on the cash register, raking in the day's takings right before her eyes.

But! As they say, money isn't everything. I want something for the soul.

My entire gang is dressed in the latest fashion—black, skin-tight baggy-wash pants. Fitted jackets without slubs but with huge shoulder pads almost double the width of our not-so-small shoulders. And we've got some serious flywheels, especially Kira's—nature has compensated for that bastard's lack of intelligence. Everyone's wearing heavy, forged army boots—an essential item in a fighting game.

"So boring!" Josh yawns, looking around at the regulars at Korovyaki.

There are three girls sitting on swivel chairs near the counter, but there are four of us, and the law of the pack is strict: one for all, and all for one. So that option is out. Although it would be a shame to miss such a freight train. All the girls are wearing stunning outfits, wearing pink, green, and orange wigs that they probably had to work their asses off for two or three weeks to buy. Their faces are brightly made up. Mouths, cheeks, rainbows around their eyes with long, glued-on eyelashes. They are wearing black, shiny, straight dresses that barely cover their buttholes.

The stereo blares hysterically. The singer's queer voice darts from corner to corner, bouncing off the walls like a bullet expelled from a gun barrel. The cloying howl of rock star Bertie Lasky spits the lyrics to his latest hit, "Fallen Angel," into the audience. One of the charming women at the bar—in a cool green wig—pushes her stomach out and in to the music.

I feel the needles hidden in the milk start to prickle somewhere in my pants. I jump up and yell, "Come on, come on, come on!" Then, for some reason, I slap the stunned man next to me in the ear, but he doesn't even notice, continuing to mumble. Never mind, he'll feel his eardrum rupture when he returns from his distant travels.

"Where are you going?" Josh came to.

— It doesn't matter where. Some fresh air. Anything to avoid seeing those disgusting faces. Let's go for a walk, friends. Let's get some fresh air and see who's there, with whom, and how much it costs.

We spill out of the bar into the vast winter night and float down Marganita Boulevard, where we quickly find something to relieve the boredom. A rambling old man, resembling a sick parrot, only with glasses and a stack of books under his arm, flutters toward us. In his other hand, he holds an old black umbrella. He's apparently returning from the public library, which only idiots like teachers frequent these days. In my pleasant town, few dare leave their homes after dark: there aren't many police, and there are plenty of slackers like us.

We row up to our "professor" and I say very politely: "Excuse me, sir."

Coming out of his clever thoughts, he timidly looks at the four of them, quiet, polite, smiling, and asks in a loud teacher's voice: "Yes? What do you want?" And he looks so insolently, as if he wasn't at all afraid.

"I see you have books, sir?" I asked, still politely. "It's rare to meet a person who reads these days."

"Oh, what are you saying!" he replies, his whole frail body trembling and his gaze darting suspiciously from one to the other.

"Really, Professor, would you be so kind as to show me the books that are now being issued at the library? It's so nice to hold a clean, new book with crisp pages in your hands."

"Clean... hmm... clean?" the teacher doesn't understand, and at that moment Pete, who has crept up behind him, snatches three thick books from under his arm and hands them to me.

I quickly distribute them among everyone except Kir. I got "Fundamentals of Crystallography." I open the book and deliberately slowly flip through the pages. Then, pretending to peer closely at the lines, I say with feigned indignation:

"No, just look at it! The obscenities they write in those clever books. You've made me blush, Professor, and left me very, very disappointed."

“But… but… excuse me,” he squeals. “What is this you…”

"Look at mine," Josh chimes in. "Every word in here is swearing. Here, look." He holds out an open copy of Snowflake's Miracle Transformations. "It's got both an 'h' and a 'p'."

"It's pure pornography," Kir confirms, peering over his shoulder. "It tells you the positions he fucked her in, and there are even pictures attached. No, sir, you're definitely an old pervert."

"How shameful! Such a distinguished-looking old man..." I say reproachfully, and begin methodically ripping pages out of the book and throwing them into the air.

Kir follows my example, helping Pete gut a thick volume of Descriptive Geometry.

The professor rises up like a goose whose feathers are being plucked alive:

— What are you doing? These books aren't mine—they're municipal property. What barbarity! What vandalism!

Kir interprets the unfamiliar words as curses and lightly punches the screaming teacher in the head. The teacher goes completely berserk and tries to take the box away. From the outside, it looks very touching.

“No, you need to be taught a lesson, you old bastard,” I say good-naturedly.

This crystallography book was carefully crafted back in the days when things weren't disposable but durable. The thick binding, holding the pages tightly, resists the knife for a long time, but I finally manage to tear it apart, and now the pages are floating in the air like giant white snowflakes. Amidst this leaf fall, a titcher darts, pursued by a madly laughing Cyrus. Pete and Josh have also managed to get their books under control and are throwing whole armfuls of book pages into the air.

"Here you go, you old lecher," they burp cheerfully.

The teacher tries to resist weakly, and then I say:

"That pervert hasn't gotten to the point yet, my friends. Now that's the intelligentsia. He even put on his hat."

Then Pete grabbed the shaking teacher by the hands and twisted them back. He yanked the moron's hat sharply by the brim and slammed it around his neck with a crack. Then he punched him in the mouth. Josh ripped the teacher's glasses off, tried them on, threw them on the sidewalk, and danced a little swan dance on them, only instead of pointe shoes, he was wearing heavy army boots. The teacher hissed something through his toothless mouth, but Pete poked him in the bloody hole a couple of times. The teacher groaned. A beautiful scarlet blood flowed from his mouth. It dripped onto his white coat and trowsers. It was a magnificent sight!

Finally, we got fed up. We cut up the teacher's dress and scattered it all over the street, smashed the umbrella onto the pavement, and, kicking the teacher once as a farewell, we moved on, ignoring his loud groaning (he no longer had the strength to scream).

On Lost Avenue, we stopped at a soup kitchen where several toothless old women were spilling their soup. We were good boys now, polite, smiling, well-behaved. But for some reason, these old hens trembled and clucked in fear at the sight of us. A waiter approached—a skinny, nervous guy—and eyed us suspiciously. We ordered him four pistons of Old Veterans—a popular cocktail of rum, sherry brandy, and lime juice. Then I added:

"And bring those God-given dandelions something truly nutritious, not pig swill. Otherwise, they'll die from your charity right here in your snake pit."

With these words, I dug a few crumpled bills out of one of my pockets and plopped them down on the table. The others followed my example. Soon, the old women were served stewed meat with mashed potatoes and, once again, tender stewed vegetables, along with a can of beer. The old birds sent us the most charming smiles and nodded gratefully, shaking their hair.

And then something came over us. We started grabbing whatever we could find from the counter: General Yankee cognac, cookies, chocolate, cheese, ham, moth and roach repellents, and showering our dear Grannies with it. Having thus rid ourselves of the Manes, we winked cheerfully at our charmers and said we'd be right back. "Thank you, boys. God bless you!" they responded in unison.

We all headed out to Attlee Street, full of concession stands and morbid shops we hadn't visited for three months. It was very quiet now. The Coppolas and their patrol cars had relocated further across the river, where Billy Boy's gang was operating.

We donned our newly acquired masks (we'd raided a theatrical prop shop last week) and transformed ourselves into historical figures. I was Disraeli, Pete was Elvis Presley, Josh was Henry VIII, and old Keir was the unfortunate poet P.B. Shelley. The masks were truly cool—thin rubber, with real hair and other facial features. And very comfortable. When the job was done, they could be rolled up and stuffed into boots. The three of us entered the shop, with Pete keeping watch, just in case. Seeing such unusual characters in his store, the owner, Mr. Slaus, with his thick, jug-like snout, darted into the back room, where the telephone was kept, and perhaps a gun was hidden. Keir leaped over the counter in a flash, intercepted him in the doorway, and grappled with him, holding him on his head. They rolled between the shelves of all sorts of cans, knocking them over and creating an unimaginable noise. For a moment, a furious puffing and snorting could be heard from behind the counter, then the sound of a bottle breaking on someone's head, a scream... and the noise of the struggle died down. Kir managed to pinch the burly Slaus. An embarrassed Debila rose from behind the counter, adjusting his crooked mask. Mother Slaus, her breasts full, stood frozen behind the cash register, a stone woman. I realized that in another second she would scream louder than a police siren. So, saying, "Fucking woman, how old you've gotten," I jumped up to her and covered her mouth with one hand, the other tucked into her bosom, where appetizing bubbles were visible through her cleavage. She was so plump, so soft, and smelled so deliciously of French perfume that my fifth limb trembled with a fiery fervor, and I started to flow. But then the bitch sank her teeth into my palm, and I howled in pain like a lynx wounded in the ass. When I instinctively pulled my hand away, Madame Slaus let out a deep, bass voice that would have brought every Coppola in the neighborhood to town within minutes. I had to quickly shut up the fountain, so I stuffed half a loaf of sausage into her mouth and, for good measure, hit her head with a drawer opener, crumpling her exquisite coiffure. Blood gushed from her cut forehead like from a slaughtered pig. She collapsed unconscious on the floor, and while I was emptying the cash register, Josh managed to lift her dress over her head and give her a deep massage. The bastard beat me to it. I looked with regret at her beautiful naked breasts, and then decided that it was not evening yet.

We had to get going. Grabbing a couple of blocks of top-notch malignant tumors, we headed out into the frosty night.

We kept two packs of the expropriated tumors for ourselves, and threw the rest into the nearest shelter.

“What a huge jerk this Slaus is,” Kir complained.

I looked at him. I didn't like his appearance: he looked like he'd just gotten out of a fighting game, which, frankly, he had. But we had to look casual. So we went into a side alley and cleaned him up. We hid our masks and soon emerged onto the Duke of New York. Checking my watch, I noted with satisfaction that we'd only been gone ten minutes.

Our red mullets sat in the same place and lustfully sipped beer from cans, hugging our gifts with their unoccupied hands.

We plopped down at the table and rang the bell. A waiter appeared, and this time we ordered beer and rum.

— We never went anywhere, grannies. Right?

The understanding witches nodded their shaking heads in agreement.

— That's right, boys. You just went out to pee, but otherwise you were here the whole time.

It was just a necessary precaution. The Coppolas woke up almost half an hour later. Two rosy-cheeked first-years, whom we might have once beaten up, noisily tumbled into the cafeteria and stared at us suspiciously from under their police helmets with their visors raised.

— You didn’t hear anything about what happened at Slaus’s shop?

"We?" I made my most innocent face. "And what, exactly, were we supposed to hear?"

— Robbery and rape. Slaus and his wife were taken to the hospital. What have you been doing for the last hour?

"First of all, tone it down, my friend," I said cheekily. "And don't insult decent people with your vile suspicions."

"They've been sitting here all evening," the old ladies squealed in unison. "Such generous, well-behaved fellows. You rarely meet people like them these days."

"We were just asking," one of the visors said sullenly. "Everyone has their own job..."

The guards cast us heavy, distrustful glances and left, followed by Pete and Josh, who followed them with an international crankshaft motion jersey, vigorously slamming their right hands into the middle of their outstretched lefts. But for some reason, I felt sad. Not a single worthy opponent! However, the night was just beginning.

  

At the municipal substation, we ran into Billy Boy's gang. There were six of them, but that didn't bother us. Back then, everyone traveled in packs of four to six—that's how many people fit in a car. Only occasionally did we form larger gangs for nightly wall-to-wall fighting.

They noticed us, just as we noticed them. This was going to be a real drag race—with knives, brass knuckles, chains, and razors. I grinned pleasantly, and we exchanged the traditional pleasantries:

\- Scratch my bald head, Billy, you son of a bitch, is that you?

"Alex, what people, and without security! Glad to see you without a noose around your neck."

And so on and so forth. The ritual was over, and it began!

I couldn't get to Fatty Billy. I danced around him, razor in hand, like a barber around a customer on a ship's deck on a stormy night. Billy-boy had a long, narrow stiletto, which he held outstretched, keeping me from getting any closer. But he was too slow for me, and when he tired, I began "shaving" him. You can't imagine the pleasure of slashing first one fat cheek, then the other! When I carved an "X" into his forehead, the blood gushed out, blinding him, and he completely lost his bearings. He began to thrash around like a blinded bull, jabbing his useless knife at random.

At that moment, the distant wail of police sirens could be heard. Encountering the cops wasn't in our plans, so we sprinted in the other direction. We ducked into a dark alley and caught our breath. Soon we found ourselves in Priestley Square, where a pigeon-scattered bronze statue of an old poet with a Pithecanthropus jaw and a pipe stood. Heading north, we came across an old film strip, where about thirty cars were parked, where girls and boys like us were making out, screwing, and getting high. Most of the cars were old, but Pete had dug up a pretty decent '95 Durango somewhere; its owners, apparently short on cash, had gone off to smash up the nearest shop. Josh had a first-class set of lockpicks, and soon we were cutting through the deserted city streets.

It was much darker outside the city. The highlight of our program was approaching: an unexpected visit to one of the suburban cottages.

We stopped at the edge of some village, at a lonely bungalow surrounded by a neat garden. A wild excitement had taken hold of everyone. Apparently, it was the moon, grinning across its pale face. In its light, the cottage was as clear as day. We even read the sign on the gate: "OUR HOUSE." We thought it was very funny, and we laughed our heads off. I got out of the car, ordering my guys to shut up. Quietly opened the gate and approached the front door. I knocked politely, but no one answered. I knocked harder, and this time I heard approaching footsteps behind the door. The lock clicked, the door opened slightly, and someone's eye peered questioningly at me through the crack.

\- Yes? Who's there?

The voice was young, clear, and cheerful. Undoubtedly, it belonged to a nice girl. Politely, in a gentleman's voice, I said pleadingly:

"Pardon me, madam. I really hate to disturb you at such a late hour, but my friend and I were admiring the beautiful moon in your picturesque surroundings when she suddenly felt ill. She felt a twinge in her side. Appendicitis, probably. The poor thing is groaning and writhing in pain by the road. Would you mind using your phone to call an ambulance?"

"But we don't have a phone," the girl replied. "I'm very sorry, but you'll have to ask someone else."

From somewhere deep in the house came a steady "clack-clack-tap-tap-clack-clack-tap-tap." Some idiot was typing. Then he stopped typing, and a strong male voice rang out: "Who's there, dear?"

"I'm so sorry, dear lady. Well, then at least a glass of water for the person in trouble. You see, the poor thing is half-fainting. I just don't know what to do with such a severe attack."

"Water—that's fine," the girl agreed, both cheerfully and compassionately. "Wait a minute."

She left, but the bitch didn't take off the chain. Besides, it wasn't necessary now. These chains aren't for thieves, but for their owners. Slipping my hand through the crack, I easily removed it, and all four of us slipped into the hallway. Well, that was her mistake. You have to close the door on strangers who show up in the middle of the night.

We burst noisily into the cozy, tastefully furnished living room and began jumping, yelling obscenities, squealing, and hooting like Kokomoro Indians. At the sight of the uninvited guests, the girl made an "O" with her brightly painted mouth, and the young man in horn glasses raised his head from his typewriter and looked at us quizzically. Paper sheets were scattered across the table in front of him. To the right of the typewriter, they were folded into a neat column. We were lucky with intelligent men that evening. This one was also a bookworm, perhaps even a writer. He said calmly:

— What's the matter? Who are you and why are you breaking into my house without permission?

However, his voice and hands were visibly shaking.

"Fear not! Humble yourself, despised one, and bow your head before what fate has in store for you."

Josh and Pete went to rummage around the kitchen, and Kir remained standing next to me, waiting for orders, his mitten wide open.

"What's this?" I asked, pointing at the stack of papers near the typewriter.

Spectacled ferret with indignation of rispondids:

— That's exactly what I wanted to know. What is this? What do you want from us? Get out of here before I throw you out.

"Hee-hee-hee!" cackled the Moron in the P.B. Shelley mask.

"Ah, it's a book!" I said understandingly. "You're writing a book. I respect writers and scribblers."

Taking the top sheet, I read the title: "A CLOCKWORK ORANGE."

— What a dumbass! Couldn't you come up with anything more stupid? Are there really such things as clockwork oranges?

Then he read aloud in a solemn, otherworldly voice:

“…against attempts to forcibly impart to Man, the beautiful creation of the Lord God, the crown of the Universe, called to do Good, the properties of a mechanical doll and the creation of conditions and laws leading to this, I raise my voice…”

Kir lifted his leg and loudly exclaimed, "A kiss for my beloved." Laughing, I began tearing up the pages of this latest nonsense and scattering the scraps across the room. At the sight of this, the writer literally went wild and lunged at me, clutching the yew and clenching his fist. But then Kir stepped in. The small space made his chain useless, and for such a weakling with narrow shoulders and a hemorrhoidal backside bulging from sitting for so long, it wasn't necessary. He met him with several precise blows from his brass knuckles, instantly turning the writer's face into a complete mess. Blood spurted out, spattering his shirt, the carpet, the pages on the table, and he passed out, burying his nose in his stupid "ORANGE," hugging her like his only child.

His faithful, beautiful, slender wife seemed to have frozen to the fireplace, her hand clasped over her mouth in horror and her eyes wide, their blueness dazzling. Then she rushed toward her defeated husband.

At that moment, Josh and Pete swarmed in from the kitchen. They were chomping on something, still wearing their masks. Josh held a turkey leg in one hand and a frost-covered can of beer in the other.

"Stop eating!" I ordered. "You better bring this intellectual to his senses. And hold him down so he doesn't get upset. We'll teach him a lesson from real life."

Pete walked up to the writer and slowly poured an ice-cold can of beer over his clever head. He perked up, straining to see through his broken glasses. Pete jerked his head back, roughly grabbing him by the hair.

\- Okay, Kir. Now let's get to the little missus. See how upset she is. We need to calm her down.

The moron twisted Gerlin's arms, and I, approaching from the front, yanked open her white satin blouse and nearly choked on my saliva—her beautiful, full breasts stared at me with the pink orbs of her nipples. I pushed her onto her back and, despite her pitiful cries and frantic resistance, did the age-old "back and forth" to her. The enraged writer nearly broke free from Josh and Pete's grip on him. He hurled curses at us the likes of which I've never heard, even though I'm not an intellectual.

Then Kir, Pete, and Josha did the same thing one after another, huffing, puffing, and squealing with excitement. She offered no resistance to Josha anymore. She only sobbed softly, looking away and biting her lip until it bled. The struggling writer had to be subdued again, smashing his head against the typewriter a couple of times. Then we performed a victory dance, smashing and breaking everything we could get our hands on. We wanted to set the bungalow on fire, but I ordered them to stop. Let them live, if they can, and finally descend from heaven to sinful earth.

After drinking a can of beer from the fridge, we jumped into the car and raced back to our jungle, crushing everything living that came under the wheels along the way.

  

On the drive toward the city, near the Industrial Canal, where mud, feces, and dead animals floated, the engine suddenly coughed, sputtered, and died. But that didn't matter: the subway station was visible ahead. We had to decide what to do with the car: leave it with the Coppolas or send it to the bottom of the canal. Everyone agreed on the latter. Laughing, we accelerated the car, and its farewell "splash" put a semicolon on that evening. It was only one stop to the center. I barely managed to calm my enraged friends. I paid the required fare, and we waited for the commuter train, plastering on expressions of humility and good manners, just in case. True, while I was buying tickets, Kir managed to smash a couple of vending machines, so now his pockets were stuffed with change and chocolate bars, which he intended to hand out to the downtrodden and insulted. But there weren't any nearby. A dozen idiots were dozing in the car, and to kill time (a whole three minutes!), we cut up and gutted the seats, and old Kir, practicing with the chain, smashed out a window.

Having got out in the center, we slowly headed to our “Korovyaka”.

The crowd at Korovyak was mostly teenagers, or, as we called ourselves, "nadsads." But there were also a few older regulars, men and women (but not the bourgeoisie, we couldn't stand them). People were laughing, singing, and talking loudly, trying to be heard above the noise and din. At a separate table sat a strange group of actors and extras, rehearsing for some show at the television studio around the corner. My attention was drawn to a stunning girl among them, with a carnivorous, painted mouth and a multitude of teeth as white as the milk served there (it seemed to me they grew in four rows). She laughed carefree, as if she didn't give a damn about anything in this crazy, crazy, crazy world. Johnny Zhivago, one of the idols of Russian-born punks, finished (along with several punks) the stinking hit "Only Every Other Day." Suddenly, my girlfriend stood up resolutely and, in the ensuing silence, began singing, as if proving something to her friends at the table. How she sang! You won't believe it, but it seemed to me as if a bluebird had suddenly flown into our dirty, stinking glass. Goosebumps ran all over my body. My breath caught in my throat, my eyes stung. I recognized what she was singing. It was an aria from Friedrich Gitterfenster's opera "Das Bettzeig." It was the very part where she sings with her throat slit, saying from her heart, "Now I'm finally happy..." Be that as it may, I was literally frozen.

But at that moment, the stinking cretin Kir let out a dirty curse at her, which I do not dare to quote here, trying to describe everything that happened to me in pure Nadsad language.

The fool ruined the song, and I struck his vile mouth with my fist. He looked dumbfounded, not understanding what was going on, mechanically wiping the blood from his lip.

"Why did you do this?" he asked, puzzled.

— For your brute manners. So that you learn to behave in public.

"I don't get it," he said dully. "But I really didn't like it. Don't ever do that again. From now on, I'm neither your friend nor your brother."

With these words, he pulled out a huge handkerchief of the third freshness from his pocket and, puzzled, began to blot his bleeding lip, as if it was always others who were supposed to bleed, but not him.

Gerla didn't hear Debil's rudeness. She finished singing and was already laughing merrily again with her friends. Kir hadn't insulted her, but me. And I said with dull irritation:

"If you don't like it, never do it again. And if you do, I'll turn you off."

Josh, who heard our conversation, said in a conciliatory tone:

\- Stop it, brothers. Are you crazy?

"This will sober Kira up a bit. He's gone completely nuts. It's time for him to grow up."

I looked Josh in the eye. Kir managed to stop the bleeding, and he muttered resentfully:

"What right does he actually have to give us orders, let alone fight us? It wouldn't be me if I didn't gouge his eyes out with a chain at the first opportunity."

“No, you definitely want me to tickle your liver,” I said menacingly.

"Are you crazy? Are we friends or not?" Pete said philosophically. "They're already laughing at us."

“Kir should know his place and not stick his neck out when he’s not asked,” I repeated stubbornly.

"That's something new," Josh said unkindly. "I wonder who determines everyone's place?"

Pete supported him:

"To tell you the truth, Drunkard, you shouldn't have lashed out at your friends. You hurt Kir unfairly. If it had happened to me, I wouldn't have tolerated it either. Remember that and think before you start a fight next time. I've said it all..."

And he buried his face in his glass. My insides were seething, but I suppressed the passionate desire to punch this smartass in the horns and said judiciously:

"Every pack needs a leader, there needs to be discipline. Or am I wrong?"

Everyone sat there, their faces sour and silent. Not a single one even nodded. My inner irritation was growing, but outwardly I remained calm and reasonable.

"I was your leader for quite a long time, and you never got into trouble with me. Am I right or wrong? Why the hell are you keeping quiet? Or have you just got your tongues in your asses?"

They nodded reluctantly. All except Kir. He dabbed his lip one last time, put the cloth away, and said, unexpectedly amicably:

"You're right, Alex, you're right. Calm down. We're just talking. We won't talk about this anymore."

I was terribly surprised and even a little frightened to hear such wise things from the Debila. He continued:

"The best thing now is to kick the bucket and see what's going on in the next world. About six hundred minutes. So, friends, off to the houses?"

We ran in different directions.

I headed for council estate 18A, sandwiched between Kingsley Avenue and Wilsonsway, where I lived with my phaser and maser. I reached the entrance to the gloomy communal building without incident, though I kept checking my cutter in my pocket in case Billy Boy's buddies were waiting for me somewhere in a dark alley. As I approached the building, I saw a groaning and writhing respectable boy in a gutter and the blood-soaked remains of his girlfriend's underwear, dragged off somewhere further. Oh, the times, oh, the morals! Sighing, I entered the spacious entrance. Its walls were covered with optimistic paintings: completely naked men in the ecstasy of work at machines, tools, and computers. Of course, local "artists" contributed their share to these remarkable masterpieces of post-industrial art, painting them with good-quality, hairy, standing privy parts and supplying them with strong inscriptions in the nadsa, which I do not dare to quote here, so as not to offend the refined ears of my readers.

One glance at the elevator, painted in the same manner, was enough to realize it wasn't working. Some incredibly strong guy (as strong as he was stupid) slammed his foot (or rather his head) on the door so hard that it jammed. I had to stomp up to the tenth floor, a foot.

Oh, if only I could find this bastard!

I opened the door to apartment 10-8 with my key. The apartment was quiet. My ancestors were in a slumberous kingdom. Mom had left dinner for me in the kitchen—a few slices of canned, porous smoked meat, bread, butter, and a glass of milk. Good old milk, without any hidden needles, synthetics, or drencrom. How evil can innocent white milk be! I ate, reluctantly at first, then greedily. I also took a fruit pie from my beer bottle and devoured it completely. Having filled my belly, I headed to my room, shedding my dress as I went.

My den was worth a visit. In the corner next to my bed stood a state-of-the-art stereo system—a source of particular pride and unearthly pleasure. The hanging shelves held a carefully selected selection of CDs, the walls were hung with flags and pennants of every size, and portraits of my favorite singers and movie stars in revealing poses and positions. A special cabinet held souvenirs from my life in various penal colonies (I first arrived there before I was eleven).

Speakers were hung in every corner of my room. They were also on the walls, the ceiling, and the floor. When I lay down on my bed and listened to the stunning music, it was as if I were in the middle of an orchestra. The music enveloped me like a web, penetrating every fiber of my being. Now I wanted to hear the violin concerto performed by the divine Odysseus Coerilos, accompanied by the Macon, Georgia Philharmonic Orchestra. Reverently, I took the record from the shelf, placed it on the player, and immersed myself in the wondrous world of music.

Gradually, grace descended upon me. The music lifted me up and carried me, naked, through the ceiling, the roof of my wretched dwelling, into the abyss of the universe. I felt every sound tangibly, could touch it with my hand, play with it like a butterfly. The rich brass of trombones resounded beneath the bed, the gold of trumpets poured from the ceiling, turning my insides upside down. And, wonder of wonders, the magical sounds of a solo violin floated in on an airship. It seemed as if the bow were piercing my heart, traveling along my exposed nerves, extracting a healing balm that soothed, enveloping my skinless body like a mother's placenta...

The ancestors, accustomed to this, didn't dare knock on the wall of my room. Let them take a sleeping pill if I'm disturbing them. Truly, I always got off on this kind of music better than any synthesizer. I felt like I was in heaven, and it seemed to me as if I were talking to God Himself. In such moments, phantasmagorical images surrounded me. All around were men and women in white robes, young and old, healthy and infirm. They fell on their faces, begging for mercy. I laughed and crushed their faces with my army boots. And there were also young girls with full breasts, and I pounced on them like a hungry beast, tore at their sweet bodies and raped, raped... The music reached its climax, and so did I. I screamed wildly, drooled, moaned, screamed, yelled. I came with the last notes of the violin. After that, I put on "Jupiter" by the divine Mozart, and with it, the faces that needed to be crushed reappeared. For dessert, I saved the old, strong, energetically solemn Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music always restored my physical strength and mental balance. "Brandenburg Concerto." As I listened to it, for some reason, the silly sign above the cottage gate—"OUR HOUSE"—floated before my eyes. Then a white sheet of paper with the title "A CLOCKWORK ORANGE" written in large letters. Now, as I listened to J.S. Bach, the hidden meaning of this strange title began to dawn on me. But will I ever fully grasp it?

  

I woke up promptly at eight this morning, feeling absolutely disgusting. I couldn't seem to open my eyes, so I decided to take a break from my whining, at least for the first half of the day. I'd lie around for an hour or two, then get up, take a shower, put something on my teeth, listen to the radio, and maybe even check out some of the nonsense in the newspapers. Later in the day, if I feel like it, I'll pop into our madhouse where they fill our bins with all sorts of useless nonsense.

Half asleep, I heard my dad grumbling as he got ready to go plowing in his stinking dye shop. Then came the cautious voice of my mommy, who had come to respect me now that I had grown big and strong.

— It's already eight, honey. Get up if you don't want to be late for school again.

"My head's splitting a bit. I think I'll sleep for an hour and then we'll see."

Mom sighed sadly and said meekly:

— Your breakfast is on the stove, son. Well, I'm off.

That's right. You can't shirk work, even if your kid's about to close his eyes—they'll fire you in a heartbeat. Mom toiled at Statesmart, stocking shelves with canned soups, beans, salami, ham, and other poisons from morning until night. I heard the oven door slam, then Mom put on her coat and shoes and said hesitantly, afraid to disturb me:

\- Well, I'm off. Don't stay out late tonight.

The front door clicked, and everything fell silent. I buried my nose in the pillow with pleasure and sank into a sweet sleep. For some reason, I dreamed of Josh; I wouldn't have seen him in his white Adidas shoes. He seemed older, sternly reprimanding me about discipline, humility, and submission, and also about how all the boys must now obey him unquestioningly and salute. I, too, stood in line, eagerly repeating "yes, sir" and "no, sir," and suddenly noticed the large stars on his shoulders, as if he were a general.

Josh pointed sternly at me and barked:

"This bastard's uniform is covered in sh...t. He's a disgrace to our valiant, idiotic, degenerate army. Come on, let's clean him up."

I looked at my clothes and realized with horror that he was right.

"Don't hit me, brothers!" I screamed at the top of my lungs and ran.

But for some reason I was running in circles, returning to the same spot, like an orange tied to a string when you spin it. Kir was hot on my heels, laughing madly and cracking his whip, which kept coming down on my back and butt. The physical pain was compounded by a terrible headache, in which a bell suddenly rang loudly…

It's weird. No one's supposed to know I'm home. The doorbell continued to ring brazenly, and then a familiar voice came from behind the door:

\- Get up, you slob, I know you're home.

I winced as if I'd been pinched, recognizing the voice of P.R. Deltuva, my guardian from the idiotic Post-Corrective Law Enforcement Assistance Society. Mr. Deltuva was a life-weary, worn-out nerd who was supposed to oversee hundreds of morons like me. "Right now, right now!" I shouted hastily, donning a loose silk robe adorned with printed images of post-industrial paradises. I slipped my feet into warm felt slippers and prepared to receive a guest, who I welcomed like a sheep to a butcher's knife. When I opened the door, my mentor stood there, a mournful expression on his sour face, wearing a worn, old-fashioned hat and a greasy raincoat.

"Ah, Alex, my boy," he smiled wearily. "I met your mother, and she said you weren't feeling well, and that's why you didn't go to school."

"Exactly, sir. A terrible headache," I said in a polite tone. "I think it will be over by lunchtime."

"Yes, by evening, that's for sure," Deltuva said with hidden sarcasm. "It's your favorite time of day, isn't it, boy? Sit down. Sit down, sit down," he invited, as if this were his home, not mine.

He settled into my phaser's rocking chair like he owned the place, as if he'd come to rock, not to be rocked. I politely offered him a cup of tea.

"No time at all, son," he replied, chuckling. "With you guys, I don't even have time for a cup of tea."

However, he continued to swing carefree, in no hurry to leave, and I turned on the electric kettle.

— To what do I owe your visit, sir? Has anything happened?

"What happened?" he said, narrowing his eyes slyly. He picked up a newspaper from the table. The front page featured a gorgeous woman with her breasts hanging out, advertising the delights of Yugoslav resorts. After devouring it in one sitting, my mentor said with a fake smile:

— But was anything supposed to happen? After all, you personally didn't do anything?

“Well, it’s just a figure of speech, sir,” I said, not falling for his clumsily thrown hook.

"Well, since we're talking about turns of phrase, consider mine as well, just for the sake of conversation. If next time something really happens, you won't get off with a correctional school for the troubled. You'll end up in a real prison... and you'll let me down badly. All my work with you will be for nothing. If you don't think about yourself, then at least think about me and your parents..."

"But, sir, where do such gloomy thoughts come from? The Coppolas, that is, the cops, or rather, the police, have no complaints against me. I am pure and immaculate, like the Holy Virgin Mary."

— Yeah! You're more suited to the role of a penitent Magdalene. Although I can imagine Magdalene with such... Oh well, let's leave religion alone. Now, don't give me that crap about the police. They don't have anything on you until they've grabbed you... You don't want to tell me about the fight last night? Someone had a lot of fun, using knives, bicycle chains, and similar harmless toys. You weren't there, of course. A fat guy, by the way, also one of my charges, was picked up by an ambulance last night near the city substation and taken to the hospital. In his delirium, Billy mentioned your name. The information reached me through the usual channels. The names of your friends were also mentioned. Of course, no one can prove anything. But I'm warning you, kid, warning you as a friend, as the only person who can save you from yourself...

“I really appreciate your concern, sir,” I said dispassionately,

"You appreciate it? What are you saying!" Deltuva chuckled with genuine bitterness. "Well, I warned you. We know a lot more than you think, Alex. What the hell possessed you, boy? We've been studying this problem for over a century, but we still can't solve it. You have a good home, loving parents. And your mind seems to be fine. Tell me, what's gnawing at you inside? Maybe I'll understand. After all, I spent almost forty years raising people like you..."

“Nobody can pin anything on me,” I repeated stubbornly. “I haven’t been detained for over three months.”

"That's what worries me most," Deltuva sighed. "You've been a good boy for a suspiciously long time. You don't even notice that you're approaching a critical point."

\- Yes, sir, but I'm as clean as a whistle. You can rely on me.

I charmed him with a typically American, toothy smile. Handing him a cup of strong, natural tea, I chuckled at all the oohs and aahs from Deltuva and his fellow educators. Okay, fine! Granted, I'm acting like crap—fighting, biting, striking, cutting the weaker with a knife and razor, and rapping the girls I like. But everyone does that in our lousy society. Did I make its laws? I just live by them. So why does he keep droning on about loving me? What universal love do he and his ilk stink of? Three months in one correctional facility, six months in another. And now he's lovingly promising to lock me away in yet another zoo. And not a single creature has any idea how much I hate the cage. All this talk about the causes of evil and violence makes me laugh until I'm colicky.

Why not first understand what makes a person good, and what goodness even is? Personally, I believe that people are (or rather, pretend to be) kind because it pleases them (or is profitable). Others enjoy being cruel, evil, and merciless. Nature, too, must necessarily have predators and their prey, otherwise everything in the world will degenerate and die out. Or perhaps the God who created this world rejoices when he looks upon me, is proud of me as his finest creation? And I should preserve my own self? Yet the government, the judges, and all these schools of thought strive to eradicate evil because I encroach on their privilege to be evil towards others, and they desperately need to use the guise of evil to destroy my self, turning me into a meek sheep in the common human flock they exploit? Hasn't the entire history of humanity been about the struggle of small, courageous selves against the injustice of the powerful? No, friends, seriously?

But what I do, I do because I like it.

After sighing for another five minutes, my mentor finally left. I put aside my philosophical thoughts, made myself a cup of the strongest tea with milk, adding five spoons of sugar (I have a sweet tooth), and started on the breakfast my mother had left behind. Having finished that, I picked up the newspaper. No, my friends, you should just read the blue garbage our newspapers write. You'd probably burst your stomachs, just like me. Same old story, day after day.

A new surge in violence. Bank robberies on the rise. The threat of a strike by the city's leading football team if their demands for higher wages aren't met. (Bastards! As if the ball will stop spinning if they don't play a couple of games!) Another dozen spaceships launched. (I'm sure nine out of ten are military, and all for the sake of peace on earth.) New stereo TV systems with screens half the size of a wall. But my favorite ad was: "Exchange three packets of soap flakes for canned soup labels." They've completely lost their minds.

Suddenly, a long article about today's youth (me, that is) caught my attention. Let's see what they write about us. Some smart aleck spent a long time ranting about the lack of parental discipline—that is, the responsibility of parents for raising their children—and the shortage of qualified teachers who would knock the parasitic attitude out of their students and show them the true meaning of hardship. It was impossible to read this drivel without laughing, but it was still nice to know that someone still cares about us. Actually, I wouldn't say we were being ignored. Every day, something appeared about "the upbringing of the younger generation, on whom the future of civilization depends." Of all the articles that have appeared recently, my favorite was one by an old priest in a stern priestly collar, who expressed the opinion (and he spoke as if in God's name) that "it is the devil, who was previously in other lands," who is trying to secretly inhabit the innocent souls of the younger generation, and also that adults are responsible for everything with their wars, nuclear bombs, and rampant depravity. I agreed with him on this point. He must have known what he was talking about, being closer to God than most. It seemed as if we were innocent creatures and adults were to blame for everything. I could have said, "Heer, heer, heer," as in the English Parliament.

After thinking like this for a couple of minutes, I put all this nonsense out of my head, turned on the idiot, put it around my neck, stuck the stereo earbuds in my ears, and started throwing everything out of my wardrobe, looking for something to wear that wouldn't shock the teachers too much if I happened to walk into my room. Listening to Claudius Birdman's beautiful violin quartet, I chuckled to myself, remembering an article in U.S. News about the beneficial influence of classical music on today's youth. It said that we can be healed and civilized by the beautiful world of true art. The old refrain about beauty saving the world. What the hell kind of salvation? What beneficial influence does music have? Beauty invariably evoked in me only one desire—to destroy it, since it was completely out of place in our ugly world.

And music... Music always heightened my senses. Listening to it, I felt on par with God Himself, who has the right to punish and pardon these worthless people. Music awakened the basest instincts in me and gave me a feeling of permissiveness.

I dressed as all the other students did at the time: worn jeans and a light blue turtleneck with an embroidered "A"—the initial of my name. It was high time to go to the music store (and I still had some leftover cash from the previous day) and see if the long-ordered stereo discs of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for Chorus and Orchestra, performed by the Ash Sham Symphony Orchestra under L. Mukhavir, had arrived. So I went outside.

This daytime was completely different from the nighttime. At night, it belonged to me and my friends and other bores, while the well-fed citizens obediently swallowed the slop thrown at them by TV and private broadcasters. And how they weren't sick of this nightly cud! Now the street belonged to them. And in the daytime, it was incomparably more. At the corner, I hopped on a bus and rode downtown. In the shopping arcades of Taylor Place, I stopped at my favorite music salon, the stupidly named Melody. Despite the name, it was a good place, equipped with stereo boutiques where anyone could listen to their chosen disc. The salon was empty. Old Andy, who was about twenty-four, smiled politely at me. He's generally a nice guy, always so helpful and friendly, although skinny and already noticeably balding. Andy recognized me and happily said:

\- Ah, I know why you came. I have good news for you. I received them yesterday.

He winked and went into the utility room.

Andy returned quickly, solemnly waving two huge disks in glossy white envelopes, from which Ludwig Ivan himself looked majestically and sternly at me.

"Here you go," Andy handed them to me. "Want to hear them?"

When I got home, I shot a hefty dose of heroin into my hand. Then I pulled the divine "Ninth Choral" from its sleeve and put the disc on, turning up the volume...

When Ludwig Ivan and I finished, I stretched tiredly, turned to the wall and fell asleep.

I slept until evening and woke to the clinking of cups and plates and subdued conversation coming from the dining room. It was already half past seven, and my ancestors had returned from plowing. They were sitting over a tired supper, listlessly exchanging news. But what news could they possibly have? Old age is no joy, and they were already well into their forties. Throwing on a robe, I peered out of my room and said cheerfully:

— Greetings, comrades! Have you dusted up yet?

Dad and Mom smiled tiredly.

"You've probably been through a lot all day, haven't you? I feel much better after a rest. I think I'll go work and make a buck or two."

My parents were sure I worked part-time at the store in the evenings. This was partly true: if there was one thing we didn't overlook, it was the shops and stores.

My old horse looked at me without much adoration, and there was an unspoken suspicion in his eyes, but he wisely kept silent.

After a quick dinner, I dove into the bathroom, took a shower and got dressed.

As I left the room, ready for more evening exploits, the phaser asked hesitantly:

\- Don't think that I'm interfering in your affairs, son, but I would like to know where you work so late every evening?

"Oh, wherever I can," I replied casually, cutting off any further questions with a heavy look. "I don't think I'm asking you for money for clothes, records, or other entertainment. So what's the matter?"

"No, I'm just fine," he said, embarrassed, burying his face in his cup. "It's just that I... we're worried about you. I have these silly dreams sometimes... You can laugh at me, but last night, for example, I dreamed of something I really didn't like."

"Really? And what was that?" I asked with genuine interest.

"Oh, it looked so real in the dream. Like you were lying in the dust on the sidewalk and being beaten up by your buddies, you know, the ones you hung out with before your last stint in the penal colony."

"What are you saying?" I chuckled. My old, worn-out horse sincerely believed I'd reformed after leaving the colony. Blessed are those who believe. And then I remembered a dream I'd had myself. I pushed aside these obsessive visions. I'd once heard that, unlike dreams, in real life everything is just the opposite.

"Forget about your only son and heir, my father," I began jokingly. "He can take care of himself..."

\- But you were helplessly floundering in a pool of your own blood and didn’t even resist.

“No, in dreams everything is really the other way around,” I thought to myself, and said out loud:

"It's all just women's fears, I'll give it to you. Here, take this. I earned some money yesterday. True, it's not much, but still... Enough for a bottle for you and some clothes for mom. Or maybe you could take her somewhere."

And I scooped the remaining money out of my pocket and plopped it on the table.

"Thank you, Sunny," the phaser said, touched. Then he added sadly:

"But we've been afraid to go out in the evenings lately. There's so much hooliganism around. But thanks anyway. Tomorrow I'll grab a bottle of Scotch home, and the old lady and I will share a few."

He quickly stuffed the money into his pocket so the mother washing dishes in the kitchen wouldn't notice. I walked outside, warmed by the rays of my father's love.

Much to my surprise, my entire gang was waiting for me downstairs in the entryway. The moron was intently drawing on the wall. Hearing Pete and Joshie's noisy greetings, he stopped what he was doing and, baring his large, smoke-stained teeth, began dancing around, shouting "Hurrah!"

"We were starting to worry," Josh said quietly. "We waited for you for a whole hour at the Mulberry, lapped up all the milk, and still you weren't here. We thought maybe you were upset about something, so we came... to meet you. Isn't that right, Pete?"

“Yes, yes,” Pete quickly confirmed.

"Please accept my apologies, brothers. My head's hurting like crazy. Did anyone by any chance hit me on the head yesterday?" I joked. "Anyway, I went to bed right after breakfast and only woke up half an hour ago. And so the crowd's gathered for fun, right?"

I guess I picked up that "isn't it" from my guardian, Deltuva.

"Our deepest condolences on your head," Josh said with a wry grin. "Well, of course it wouldn't hurt! You must have been overworking yourself coming up with all these orders and ways to improve our discipline. Are you sure it's stopped hurting? Maybe you should go lie down for a while longer?"

"I don't get your sarcasm, you freak," I said unkindly. "What, you guys are plotting something behind my back?" I asked harshly, pressing my back against the wall just in case. "Come on, spill the beans before I wipe those stupid grins off your faces. What are you smirking at, bastard?" I started at Cyrus, who opened his mouth in silent laughter.

Josh quickly intervened, putting his hand in his pocket in warning.

"Cut it out, Alex. Now you won't be picking on Kir or anyone else anymore."

“Now?” I asked mockingly. “What now?”

Exactly. While I was sleeping, they agreed on something. Well, we'll find out what they came up with, those stinking bastards.

\- Come on, you idiot, keep going, but not in your pants. I'm listening to you carefully.

I stood a few steps above them, casually leaning on the railing, ready at any moment to grab it and kick anyone who dared approach me in the face.

"Don't get upset, Alex," Pete said firmly, "but from now on, things will be different in our pack. We don't like it when you're constantly telling us what to do and what not to do... Don't be offended."

"That's not even the point," Josh put in irritably. "The main thing is that his childhood is playing up his ass." He stared at me insolently and even pointed a finger in my direction. "All this Boy Scout stuff, like last night. Do some mischief and run away. And we're not kids anymore!"

"So, what else? I'm listening, I'm listening," I said calmly.

"The fact is, we're sore and thirsty for your childish games. So what, breaking into a lousy shop and stuffing our pockets with small change? We're swimming in small change. But Will the Englishman told me the other day that he knows a place where you can easily pick up some yellow stuff and some pebbles. That's where the real money is!"

"Where did you manage to hook up with Will the Englishman?" I asked, outwardly calm, although inside I was seething.

"That's none of your business, Alex," Josh snapped back angrily. "Unlike some people, I'm not fixated on you. I have other friends..."

I weighed the situation for a while, and then said calmly:

— Gold? Jewelry? Did you know, you idiots, that the bigger the loot, the higher the risk of getting a real prison sentence? Have you thought about that, you bastards? I don't understand what else you need. Need a car? You steal any car, take it for a spin, and then abandon it. Money? Isn't it enough for you that we expropriate from the bourgeoisie? Where do these capitalist habits come from?

I was seriously angry. My dream had proven prophetic. General Josha was deciding what we should and shouldn't do. But I reined in my anger and decided to proceed cautiously, very cautiously. So, smiling, I said:

— Alright, brothers. Alright then. I've taught you a lot. Let's see how this works out for you now. Do you have a plan, Josha-boy?

"You're a smart guy, Alex. It's not for nothing we've had you as our leader for so long," Josh grinned with satisfaction. "Now we'll have complete democracy. No more bosses. Why don't we guys perk ourselves up with a good dose of Mad Cow Milk?"

"You've guessed my thoughts, Josh," I said with a wry smile. "I was just about to suggest we start in our good old 'Muller'. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Lead the way, my little Josh."

I stretched my mouth into a mad smile, my mind still racing. As we stepped outside, I decided that only fools think hard, while the wise act on intuition, on inspiration sent by God himself. At that moment, the wonderful music coming from a car parked nearby came to my aid. It was the final movement of a piano and violin concerto by my beloved Ludwig Ivan. The decision came instantly, and I grabbed the cutter.

“Now let’s talk, Josha-boy,” I said threateningly.

“I’m ready,” he replied, and a knife flashed in his hand.

We took a fighting stance and danced in front of each other.

“Hey, this won’t do, friends,” Kir said in a deep voice and began to unwind the chain from his belt.

"Leave it, Moron," Pete said, putting his hand on Kir's shoulder. "Let them sort it out themselves."

We circled for a while, lunging, searching for openings in each other's defenses. Seeing that my attacks were failing and I couldn't quite reach Joshie's face or eyes, I changed tactics and slashed his knife hand several times with the razor. I succeeded, and he dropped it and looked in surprise at his cut fingers.

\- Now it's your turn, Moron. Let's see who's quicker.

“Aha-ha-ha,” growled Kir, lightning-fast yanking the chain from his belt and whistling it in the air, aiming it at my eyes.

I went wild and, diving under Debila, managed to successfully slash him in the legs a couple of times. Now he, in turn, roared in pain, and I, taking advantage of his momentary hesitation, suddenly straightened up and focused on his hand, which held the chain. "Zhzhik-zhzhik-zhzhik!" I felt the cutter slide into his flush as easily as through butter. Finally, he dropped the chain and began cradling his mangled hand, kraing, like a little baby. He tried to stop the blood with his mouth, but there was too much, and he almost choked.

— Well, boys? Now you know who's boss. Don't you, Pete?

"And what about me? I didn't say anything," Pete replied. "I didn't say a word against you. We need to figure out what to do with Cyrus before he bleeds out. He'll die soon..."

"Not for anything in the world. A man dies only once, and Cyrus died before he was even born. Give him your handkerchief. You'll see: the bleeding will stop on its own."

Indeed, the main arteries were not affected, and I myself bandaged the pitifully whining Debila.

This will serve as a good lesson for them. Now they will know who is the sheep and who is the shepherd.

It wasn't difficult to calm my wounded soldiers. I took them to the nearest snack bar on Duke of New York and bought the injured two large brandies. They sipped them dejectedly and gradually recovered. Our giggly old ladies greeted us with the usual "thank you, good fellows" and "God bless you," quickly washed Kira and Joshua down with whiskey, and bandaged them with relatively clean rags. Feeling generous, Pete bought them a sandwich and a can of cider each with his own money, which he still had in his pockets. The old hags shrieked even louder:

"You're the kindest and most generous people in the world. We'll never rat you out. Finally, someone's thinking about us."

I gave Josh a hard look and said flatly:

"Listen up. I hope you're not offended? You started this first..."

"Okay, okay, okay!" he nodded quickly.

"Now is the time to talk business," I said. "You seemed to have something to offer?"

“The schizo is mowing down our ranks,” Pete noted philosophically, and Josh barked angrily:

"Shut your mouth, you'll catch a cold!" He then added thoughtfully. "I have a house in mind. With two lanterns at the entrance and a stupid name."

\- What other name?

"The Abode of Lost God's Creatures," or something like that. An old witch lives there. No servants. Just a dozen mangy stray cats she's taken in and cares for like her own children. This crazy hag has a ton of expensive antiques.

— More specifically.

"Well, there's silverware, gold, trinkets and gems. At least that's what Will the Englishman says..."

"I see," I drawled. "I think this is a really good deal."

I knew which house they were talking about. It was in Oldtown, on the outskirts of the Victoria neighborhood. A true leader must know when to tighten the reins and when to loosen them. I decided to be magnanimous.

"Okay, Josh. I like that idea. Let's go right now, without further ado."

I glanced meaningfully at the old ladies who had pricked up their ears.

"We heard nothing, we know nothing," they creaked in unison. "You were here with us the whole time."

"Exemplary girls. Absolutely excellent students," I praised them. "You'll get your incentive prizes in about ten minutes."

And I led my friends towards my own destiny.

  

Beyond the Duke of New York were the offices of the downtown business district, followed by the ancient, dilapidated public library building, and beyond that, the Victoria neighborhood, named after some victory, began. And finally, the old mansions of Oldtown swelled with luxury. Here lived a variety of bourgeois types, as old as their homes.

We soon approached a huge estate with a silly inscription on the pediment: "Abode of God's Lost Creatures." On either side of the massive cast-iron gates, like sentries on duty, stood cast-iron lanterns with round, glowing globes. A dim light flickered in one of the rooms on the ground floor. All the windows were covered with twisted cast-iron bars. Cautiously approaching one, I peered inside. And this is what I saw: an ancient woman, nearly ninety years old, with a hooked nose, bony hands, and blue-white locks of hair, pouring milk from a liter bottle into saucers, around which, with their tails puffed out like pipes, a group of cats of various sizes and colors gaped. The old woman was scolding two completely insolent, fat brutes who had climbed right up onto the dining table. The room was like a museum (though I'd never been to one and could only imagine what it must be like). Old paintings in gilded frames hung on the walls, intricate antique vampire clocks stood in the corners, and everywhere in sight were various sculptures, figurines, and miniatures made of time-darkened copper, bronze, silver, ivory, porcelain, plaster, and God knows what else. This monstrosity was undoubtedly rich. Josh whispered excitedly:

"Will the Englishman didn't screw us over. The antique dealers will pay a fortune for all this."

I had to make a quick decision to prevent Josh from taking the initiative.

"First, let's try our old, tried-and-true method—through the front door," I said quickly. "I'll ask permission to call an ambulance or get a glass of water."

“Yes, that’s how she opened the door for you,” Josh grinned nastily.

"At least we can try," I replied without much confidence. "Don't worry, I'll think of something."

I walked up to the door and rang the bell discreetly. There was no response. I rang it more insistently and, leaning toward the keyhole, whined pitifully:

— Help! For God's sake, help me, madam. My friend was hit by a car. He's bleeding. We need to call an ambulance immediately.

The light came on in the hallway, and shuffling footsteps echoed. I imagined her approaching the door, a fat cat tucked under each armpit. A deep, bass voice came from behind the door:

\- Get out, you bastard, or I'll shoot.

Hearing this, Josh burst into laughter. I continued in a pleading voice, filled with anxiety and suffering:

\- Oh, madam, don't be so hard-hearted. My friend may die.

"I said, get out, you bastard! I know your dirty tricks! Just open up to me. Then you'll be trying to sell me all sorts of junk I don't need. I'm not buying anything."

My authority was rapidly declining. Looking up, I saw a hinged casement window above the front door, large enough for a person to easily squeeze through. Luckily, it was slightly open.

I pretended to leave, but whispered, tiptoeing back to the door:

"Kir, I'll stand on your shoulders and climb in through the window. Then I'll calm this witch down and open the door for you."

Kir and I performed this simple operation under the approving glances of Pete and Josh. Seconds later, I found myself in a dark, cluttered hallway. I walked down a long corridor with numerous doors on either side. The house had at least a dozen empty bedrooms. Or perhaps each of them was intended for these disgusting, mangy beasts, fattening themselves on cream and fresh salmon? Where, pray tell, is the justice? And this while hundreds of old women like her languish in stinking flophouses!

A sliver of light was shining from under one of the doors. Listening closely, I could make out the mutterings of the deranged owner talking to her pets, who responded with loud meows, demanding more milk. Embittered, I decided to show my friends that I was worth three. I'd do it myself. If necessary, I'd calm the old lady down, make fun of her creatures so they wouldn't feel like princes and princesses, take everything most valuable... and walk out the front door. I could just imagine the jaws of those self-important freaks dropping. I'd especially enjoy wiping that upstart Josh's nose.

I quietly opened the door and surveyed the spacious hall. Beautiful nymphs with long golden hair, plump maidens holding plump babies, skinny saints leering at them, and even the emaciated, bearded Jesus Christ himself, bleeding on the cross, all looked reproachfully down at me from the walls. A stale feline stench assaulted my nostrils. The animals exuding it rubbed their flanks against the old woman's bony white legs, woven from blue sinew. She stood with her back to me, oblivious. On a century-old oak sideboard, I spotted a massive silver statuette—a beautiful, slender girl in airy robes, seemingly floating above the ground, pushing off with her graceful foot. I chose this piece for myself.

I opened the door and walked into the hall, saying mockingly:

"Hello, beautiful! We finally meet. I wasn't quite satisfied with the conversation through the keyhole, were you? I think you weren't either, you old bastard."

"Obrazina" slowly turned to me and asked angrily, but without due surprise:

"How did you get here, you freak? Don't come near me, or I'll fuck you with this bottle."

I was very amused by the sound of our jaded word "fuck" coming from her lips. I grinned and slowly approached the sideboard, from which a beautiful dancer smiled invitingly at me. The old woman placed the bottle on the table and picked up her crutch. I lovingly stroked the cool metal and suddenly, in the depths of the sideboard, noticed a bronze bust of some vaguely familiar man with long, tousled hair, empty, bulging eyes, and an old-fashioned tie. And then I realized that before me stood my idol—Ludwig Ivan Beethoven.

\- What wonderful things, and what’s most interesting is that now they will be mine...

Mesmerized, I took another step and… sprawled on the floor, my foot landing on one of the saucers.

“Your mother!..” I cursed, trying to get up.

But the old woman, with a speed incomprehensible for her age, jumped up behind me and began to hit me on the head with a stick, maliciously saying:

"There you go, there you go, you son of a bitch!"

Her blows were not strong, but still unpleasant.

"They beat us, but we grow stronger. They beat us, but we grow stronger, they beat us, but we grow stronger," I repeated jokingly with each blow.

She clearly got the hang of it and hissed:

\- I'll show you, you ass, how to break into decent people's house.

And she hit me hard on the forehead with her crutch. I was no longer in the mood for laughter, and with the next blow, I grabbed the crutch and yanked it hard. The old woman lost her balance and grabbed the tablecloth to steady herself. She lost her balance and fell to the floor, taking everything on the table with her along with the tablecloth. The milk bottles shattered, and the witch floated in a puddle like a roach in white sauce.

“May the devil take you, you scum of the human race,” she cursed in a masculine bass voice, trying to get to her feet but only raising hundreds of splashes of milk.

"Get him, my little cats! Get him! Get him!" the old woman screeched, tearing my face until it bled with her claws.

As if understanding her command, several fat brutes pounced on me, meowing hysterically. I frantically swung my fists, fighting off the frenzied creatures.

“Don’t you dare touch the animals,” the old woman said sternly when I successfully hit one of her cats and it flew into the wall.

“You old, leaky purse,” I got furious and hit her hard on the brainless head with Ivan.

She gave a weak gasp, went limp, and went silent. I straightened up, shook the cats off me, twirling one by the tail and slamming its head against the corner of the buffet, and… I heard the approaching wail of police sirens.

I'm in trouble!

And then it dawned on me that while I was eavesdropping at the door, the old woman hadn't been talking to her creatures, but calling the police. I rushed to the front door and began frantically opening a million locks and bolts. Finally flinging the door open, I saw my friends fleeing. I wanted to follow their example, but then the Moron appeared before me, holding his terrifying chain.

"Get going!" I shouted. "There'll be visors here in a minute!"

“That’s where you’ll meet them,” Kir said angrily and lashed me across the eyes with the chain.

I barely managed to close them. A searing pain exploded from the inside of my head. I grabbed my face and fell to my knees.

"I don't like being punched in the face for no reason, Alex-boy. Goodbye, my friend, comrade, and brother."

As a final blow, he hit me in the solar plexus with a heavy boot, and I tumbled off the porch. A few seconds later, the brakes of a stopped patrol car screeched. I didn't care. Tears mixed with blood streamed from my eyes. They were my eyes leaking. My eyes! I was one continuous pain. Someone roughly pulled me to my feet. Handcuffs clicked. Through the thick, bloody haze that enveloped my consciousness, someone's spoken words pierced:

— The bastard broke her head, but she’s still breathing.

"What luck!" said the second Coppola, shoving me into the car and simultaneously punching me in the kidneys. "We're having little Alex himself as our guest today."

"I'm wounded! I can't see anything, you filthy bastards, damn it..." I roared and received another blow to the solar plexus.

\- Choose your words, bitch.

Another blow to the face.

— Fuck you... First sort this out, and then start pushing. Why am I alone? Where are the others? Where are those stinking traitors I thought were my friends? I tried to talk them out of it and got a chain across my eyes. It's not my fault. I'm the victim. God will not tolerate such injustice! He will punish you! Catch them! Don't let them get away!

I screamed and fumed mostly out of inertia, fully aware that it's not the guilty party who's held accountable, but the one who got caught. Right now, those vile traitors who got away with it at my expense are probably sitting in a dive bar on Duke of New York, chuckling and pumping whiskey into our old, mangy hens. And they're nodding their heads blissfully: "Thank you, good guys. God bless you! You were here with us the whole time. And how could you not? You never left…"

I, sandwiched between two mocking Coppolas, rushed along familiar streets to the police station, trying through bloody tears to make out their names for the last time and remember what they looked like.

We pulled up to the station. They threw me out of the car. Those stinking, smug bastards had fulfilled their plan for the day. Now they won't lift a finger to take my ex-friends. And God is silent, even though He sees everything. Who said He's not a sucker?!

  

I was pushed into a brightly lit, whitewashed office, filled with the lingering stench of toilets, vomit, and disinfectant. I found myself standing before four visors sitting at a table, sipping tea from large mugs. I wouldn't have refused a sip of strong, hot tea either, but for some reason they didn't offer me any. Instead, they handed me an old, rusty mirror. I peered into it and shuddered, for instead of your handsome young narrator, I was looking at some hideous bastard with a bloody mouth, a swollen, blue nose, and watery, slitted eyes. Noticing my involuntary disgust, the Coppolas burst into laughter, and the eldest of them, with stars on his shoulders, asked:

\- Well, so what did you want to tell us, little falcon?

I snorted contemptuously and replied with dignity:

"Fuck you all, and you, you punk, go first. I won't say a word until my lawyer is here. I know the law as well as you do, you hornless goats."

They laughed loudly again, and the elder said:

"Well, guys. We'll have to convince him he's wrong. Knowing the law doesn't excuse you from responsibility."

Now, of course, they had their fill of fun at my expense, showing me the back door. And they probably would have killed me if the multi-starred inspector hadn't stopped them. Then they offered me a friendly seat. We chatted for a while, like good friends. Then P.R. Deltuva, whose office was in the same building, walked into the room. He looked miserable and said regretfully upon seeing me:

"So it happened, Alex-boy, didn't it? Just as I expected. Poor, poor, poor guy."

He turned to the Coppolas and greeted them:

— Good evening, Inspector. Good evening, Sergeant. Good evening, everyone. Our partnership is over. My God! What does he look like? Just look at him…

"Violence begets violence," the inspector said. "He resisted arrest."

“I can’t do anything more for you,” Deltuva looked at me sternly.

"Want to give this bastard a good beating, sir? Don't be shy. We'll be happy to keep him. We understand what a disappointment he's been to you."

And then Deltuva did something I never expected from him. A highly unpedagogical thing, I tell you. He came right up to me and spat in my face with hatred. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Shocked, I pulled out my bloody handkerchief and began wiping myself, repeating like clockwork:

\- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. You are very kind, sir.

He gave me a contemptuous look, turned around and, without saying a word, walked out of the cell.

The Coppolas handed me a long questionnaire, and I thought bitterly, "Damn you all, you bastards. If you call this Good, then I'm glad I'm on the Evil side."

"The hell with you, stinking pigs," I challenged them. "I'll write it all down for you, and then you can wipe your ass with your stinking report. I won't crawl on my belly for you anymore. Where do I even start? From the moment I left my last penal colony? Go ahead, little rat, and be careful not to miss anything," I addressed the frightened man sitting at the typewriter, wearing civilian clothes that didn't look like a visor at all.

The typewriter could barely keep up with my verbal diarrhea, and when I finished, he looked like he was about to fall out of his chair.

After listening to my confession, the inspector noticeably softened and said almost affectionately:

"Okay, lad. You'll be taken to your suite now, complete with running water and all the amenities. Take him away, lads. He'll sign the report later."

The cell had bunk beds, but they were all occupied. A drunken old man was snoring loudly on the top bunk. The Coppolas must have thrown him there, as he wouldn't have been able to climb up even sober. Without thinking twice, I dumped him right on top of a fat man sleeping on the floor with his pants full and quickly took his place. They scuffled for a while, not waking up, then embraced and began snoring peacefully. I lay on the reclaimed, stinking bunk, too tired and battered to sleep. For a while, I teetered on the edge of semi-consciousness, every now and then plunging into another, better world. And in that better world, oh brothers, I saw myself in a large meadow strewn with flowers, where a goat with a human face grazed. Seeing me, he sat up and began playing a painfully familiar melody on his flute. The sun rose over the meadow with the stern face of Ludwig Ivan, an old-fashioned tie and picturesquely fluttering hair, and I heard the final movement of the Ninth Symphony, with the choir shamelessly distorting the words, which, however, is permissible in a dream.

You, evil, predatory creature, defiler of the fields of Elesium,  
Know that our hearts are filled with noble anger,  
And we will tear your stinking mouth and kick your dirty ass.  
<br/>

But the melody was played flawlessly, and I woke up with this thought two or ten minutes or twenty hours, days or years later. I can't say for sure, because my watch was taken away. Somewhere far, far below stood one of the Coppolas, poking me painfully in the ribs with the end of his baton, repeating:

"Come on, wake up, Sleeping Beauty. Now you're in for real trouble."

"Huh? What?" I didn't understand, unable to shake off the "Ode to Joy" that was playing inside me.

“Come down and find out, kid,” he said with a note of compassion that made me shake off the last of my sleep.

Overcoming the pain throughout my body, I came back down to earth. The Coppola, breathing onions and cheese down my neck, led me through the corridors for a long time, until we finally arrived at a rather tidy office, with typewriters on the desks and potted flowers on the walls and windowsills. In the center, at a massive polished desk with three telephones, sat some big chief—the police commissioner, I assumed. He stared sternly into my sleepy face. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and said:

\- So, are we just going to stand here? Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night?

"I'll give you ten seconds to wipe that insolent grin off your face. Then you'll find out everything."

"I wonder what other surprise you have in store for me? Isn't it enough that I was beaten half to death, spat in the face, forced to confess to every mortal sin, and then thrown into a stinking cell with crazy criminals and perverts? What other nasty trick have you got in store for me?"

"After what I'm about to tell you, all your physical torments will seem like nothing. From now on and until the end of your days, you will be tormented by remorse. And it depends only on God's will whether you go mad or not."

And then, my friends, I realized what he was talking about. Apparently, Ludwig and I overdid it, and the old woman kicked the bucket and is now grazing her cats in the gardens of Eden. The end crept up on me. Now they'll definitely put me away for a long time. And I'm only fifteen.

# Part II  

What will happen to me now? Is this really it?

Here, my friends, begins the saddest part of my story. I ended up in Pack 84F (State Penitentiary) and went from Alex to number 6655321. I won't bore you with a pitiful tale of what a blow my arrest and conviction were to my poor ancestors, especially to my mother, whose only son, the joy of their souls, had so let everyone down.

The old judge in the lower court delivered angry speeches. He was echoed by P.R. Deltuva and the Coppolas, who were on the witness stand. And there was no one to stand up for me. I had become a thorn in the side of our establishment, and they quickly packed me away, out of sight and out of mind. A couple of weeks later, while a quick preliminary investigation was underway, my case was presented to the higher court, which, without further ado, delivered its verdict: fourteen years in prison.

Two years have passed since then, to the day, and here I am again before you, dressed in the latest prison fashion, that is, in a nasty-colored robe with the number 6655321 sewn onto the chest and back.

There is no sadder story in the world than the story of how I lived for two years in a zoo of human waste, with which, as befits waste, our sick society tried to fertilize the frail tree of public morality and ethics.

In the dirty, stinking cell I was greeted with open arms.

During the day, we toiled in a match factory, then we'd run laps around the prison yard, and in the evenings, some learned nut would clutter our minds with lectures on the lives of beetles, the Milky Way, or the Voyages of a Snowflake. Looking at him, for some reason, I always remembered another, just like him, a nerd, books tucked under his arm, returning from the public library on a winter's night... In those glorious days, I felt free and almost happy, and I had friends by my side, not vile traitors. One of them, as I learned from the visiting maser and phaser—namely, Josh—was already dead. Yes, my highly respected brothers, dead as a piece of dog shit on the road. This happened about a year after they stuck me in a cage and lost the keys. After this news, my opinion of old sucker Bog slightly improved.

But still, what will happen to me?

Sunday morning. Our entire brotherhood has gathered in the prison chapel to hear the word of God. The chaplain, who has taken a liking to me, has charged me with the duty of putting records of solemn church music on the old stereo at his signal. All the prisoners sit on the stone floor, listening to the sermon. An ineradicable stench emanates from them, not even from unwashed bodies—only corrupted souls can stink so hopelessly. I probably reek of the same, although unlike the others, there must be a tinge of hope in my stench. After all, I am the youngest of them all. My thoughts revolve around one thing: how to escape this menagerie as quickly as possible. Get out at any cost, before the prison stench consumes me completely.

“And what’s the way out of all this?” the chaplain asks loudly. “Are you really content with this vicious cycle: party, then jail, party, then jail? Or would it be better to heed God’s commandment and avoid the punishments that await unrepentant sinners both in the next world and in this one? Believe me, brothers in Christ, in the visions that have visited me, I have seen a place more terrible than any prison, where the souls of sinners like you burn in hellfire. And don’t grin, you scum. Stop laughing! There, in hell, the same degenerates writhe, scream, and moan in unbearable agony. Their nostrils are cauterized with red-hot tongs, they are roasted over a low fire, they are forced to sit there with their mouths full of water and are not removed until it boils away. And the devil knows how you’ll swallow it, since the fire blazes in their bellies too.” They swim in shit, although that won't scare you. I saw it all with my own eyes... Now, dirty pigs, let's listen to the word of God.

The chaplain picked up a thick book and, sucking on a dirty, greasy finger, began leafing through it, searching for the right place. Our spiritual father was a huge, fat bastard with a coarse, perpetually red face. I guessed that high blood pressure had nothing to do with it, but I forgave him for this small sin. He loved me and patronized me, encouraging my passion for reading the Holy Scriptures. He even allowed me to play church music while I read. And it was wonderful. He would lock me in the chapel, and I would spend hours listening to the beautiful works of J. S. Bach and G. F. Handel. I read Jewish fiction with rapture, immersing myself in a fairytale world and feeling like a character in it. I drank old Jewish wine with them, lay in bed with their chaste wives... Thus, at least for a while, I managed to escape my bestial existence. Reading the New Testament, I didn't delve too deeply into its wisdom, since instead of battles and love, it was filled with tedious sermons. But one day, the chaplain placed a thick hand on my shoulder and said, "Ah, it's you, 6655321. Think about repentance. Purification will come to you through suffering."

He reeked of old Scotch tape and had a distinct stench, distinct from that of the prisoners. Without another word, he turned and wandered off to his office to refuel. I, meanwhile, became engrossed in the heart-rending descriptions of self-flagellation, crowns of thorns, crucifixions, and other excrements, and the more I read, the more I came to the conclusion there was something to it. Caught up in Bach's divine melody, I was transported to a world imagined by the Jews and felt like one of the Romans, clad in a red toga. Like them, I prodded the tortured Christ in the back with a spear and, with relish, hammered nails into his sacred flesh…

I turned my stay in Pack 84F to my advantage, and even the Governor himself was pleasantly surprised when he was informed that I had become imbued with religious zeal. This was precisely the source of my hopes for early release.

That Sunday morning, the chaplain was reading to us from the Bible about the eccentrics who built a house on sand, and how God punished these blind men by sending a heavy rain that instantly destroyed their dilapidated structure. I thought only fools with asses for heads would come up with the idea of building a house on sand. Interrupting my thoughts, the chaplain loudly announced:

— In conclusion, my sons of bitches, let us read Psalm 435.

I quickly placed the disc on the old turntable, and powerful organ music erupted. The vocals were simply magnificent, but they were drowned out by the wild, bandit roar of the prisoners:

We are freshly brewed tea,  
weak until it's thoroughly stirred.  
We eat food not fit for angels.  
The time for atonement for our sins is long…  
<br/>

They screamed, squealed, and sobbed with abandon in every possible way, and the chaplain urged them on with the words: "Louder, you prey of the devil. Sing, everyone, don't slack off!"

Finally, the singing of the hymn was finished. The discordant choir fell silent, and the chaplain delivered the final phrase:

— May the Holy Trinity protect and watch over you. Amen!

I put on the disc of my choice—Adrian Schweigzerber's Second Symphony. The prisoners formed a ring around the stereo, listening with bated breath and drooling. Some howled like cornered wolves. Others poked me in the ribs and slapped the shoulderboard, expressing approval and affection. A certain ape-man, his hands below his knees, stood by the record player the longest. The guard gently reminded him it was time to clear out, giving him a gentle whack with his baton to the flat back of his head. I turned off the stereo, and our chaplain approached me, dressed in white clerical robes, more befitting a woman than such a jacked-up horse. After puffing for a while and blowing cigar smoke from every orifice possible, he said amiably:

\- Thank you, baby 6655321. Well, what news do you have for me today?

The thing was, our "horse" was aiming for a very high position in the prison-church hierarchy, and to get it, he needed a favorable reference from the Governor. So he visited him often and spilled everything he'd managed to learn in confession about impending riots, escapes, and the prevailing mood. I supplied him with some of this information. Of course, in most cases, it was just rumors and idle fabrications, but I needed to score points, just like the chaplain himself. Occasionally, we provided truthful information, like the one about the hulking Harriman's impending escape, which I learned about through the "cast-iron connection"—the tapping of the central heating radiators.

This time I didn't have anything significant, so I came up with the following:

"I'm always ready to help you, sir," I said. "I heard rumors over the cast-iron radio that a large shipment of cocaine has been smuggled in from the outside. The distribution center will be in one of the cells in Section Five."

The chaplain swallowed this nonsense and said with gratitude:

"Excellent, my boy. I will immediately convey this information to Himself." That was how he respectfully addressed the prison warden—the Governor.

After such words I became emboldened and decided to build on my success.

"Sir, I'm trying very hard, aren't I?" I began in an unctuous voice. "And I'm taking a lot of risks in doing so."

"You speak the absolute truth, 6655321. You are making a significant contribution to the rehabilitation of criminals, and I have long noticed signs of sincere repentance and reform in you. If you continue in this spirit, you will deserve absolution..."

"But, sir, it's like being in an African bank—you wait a long time and get nothing. The other day, I heard a conversation about a new method of re-education. They say that after such a course, you're immediately released with a guarantee that you'll never end up here again?"

"Ah, that's what you're talking about," he drawled in a dull voice. "Where did you hear that? Who's spreading these tales?"

"Well, there are persistent rumors about it... The guards are talking among themselves. You can't just plug your ears, especially since you yourself ordered them to be kept alert. Then, a newspaper got into the workshops that describes it in detail. Could you help me, sir? Don't take it as impertinence, but I really want to make amends as soon as possible..."

The chaplain was deep in thought, puffing intently on his cigar. He was obviously considering how much to share with me about what he already knew. Having made his decision, he said without much enthusiasm:

— You probably mean Ludovico’s method?

"I don't know exactly what it's called, sir, and it doesn't matter. The main thing is that it allows you to get out of prison quickly and never return."

"Yes, you're right, 6655321. But I must warn you that everything is still in the experimental stage. The technique is very simple, but it causes radical changes..."

He was clearly not telling the whole story.

"But it's used here, isn't it, sir?" I insisted. "That's why they built the white buildings against the south wall where we do our physical exercises, isn't it?"

"So far, such a method hasn't been used, at least not in our prison. Even Sam has serious doubts about it. I must admit, I share his concerns. It remains to be seen whether a person truly becomes kind after such withdrawal. Kindness is a category determined by a person's soul, 6655321, by their voluntary choice. Deprive them of that choice, and they cease to be human..."

He wanted to add something else, but then the sound of other prisoners being led away to get their religious rations was heard. So he quickly ended our conversation:

"We'll talk about this some other time. For now, set up the equipment."

Then one of the guards took me to a cell in Section Six, which became MY HOME. The guard who escorted me wasn't the worst. He didn't even give me a kick when he opened the cell door, but simply said:

\- Come on, sunny, get into your snake pit.

My cellmates represented the most refined society, not overlooked by the crime sections of newspapers and magazines.

This cell was actually designed for three people. They'd crammed us in here twice that number. That's the standard practice. Everyone grumbled, but somehow managed, practically lying on top of each other. But believe it or not, that Sunday, another prisoner was shoved into our cell. We were choking on prison gruel, and the other three were already smoking weed on their bunks, when we were suddenly blessed with a new cellmate. Right from the doorway, this shrill, twitchy old man of about fifty began wailing and complaining, shaking the thick bars of our cell: "I demand my civil rights! This cell is overcrowded! This is unheard of!" And so on, in the same vein, spirit, and tone. The guard accompanying this loud-mouthed liar (whom we promptly dubbed Loudspeaker) sternly said, fiddling with his baton:

"Ask someone to move over, or you'll be sleeping on the floor. There are more and more of you scum, and there's less and less prison space. I'd shoot such degenerates. At least they could be used as fertilizer."

He spat angrily and walked out, slamming the barred door.

  

It was the arrival of this new lunatic in our cell that marked the beginning of my escape from the Pack. Loudspeaker turned out to be not only a bazaar, but also an utterly vile, vile, and depraved individual. The trouble with him began that very same day. On top of everything else, he was a terrible braggart and began to harass us all one by one. He was a brute, the most infamous criminal in our entire menagerie. He was this, he was that, he sewed on a dozen visors in one fell swoop, and so on and so forth. Everyone was simply sick of his tales. Then he attacked me, as the youngest in the cell. He brazenly demanded that I give him my bunk while he slept on the floor. But everyone else was on my side and sternly warned him: "Stop picking on the guy! A thousand devils down your tin throat!" He withdrew for a while and started his old refrain about how no one loved or respected him. However, that night I felt someone climb onto my already narrow bunk and start caressing me, caressing me, caressing me… I punched the uninvited lover in the face and, although I couldn't see his face in the darkness, I realized it was Loudspeaker.

With difficulty, I tore myself free from his filthy clutches, jumped down, and turned on the light. Sure enough, there on my bunk sat that nasty mug I'd bloodied in that fierce fight.

My neighbors were outraged by such depravity. The Big Jew said judiciously:

"We won't let anyone harm the musician. It's unfair."

"Shut up, you Jewish mug," Loudspeaker squealed.

This was a grave insult. The Big Jew slowly stood up and took a step toward the offender. But then the Doctor intervened:

— Come on, guys. Do you want the Coppolas to use their batons again?

Of course, this was the last thing anyone wanted. The Loudspeaker, emboldened by this unexpected support, became completely brazen, declaring that everyone around him was a flunky, and he was the boss. You see, he was doing us a favor by sharing a cell with us.

"I've seen some insolent people, but none like this..." Jojon couldn't resist. "You know what, friends. We won't be getting any sleep now anyway. Let's waste no time and teach this stinking bastard a lesson in prison etiquette. He's asking for a lesson in good manners."

Big Jew grabbed the insolent man by the arms and pressed him firmly against the bars where they were illuminated by a dim red light. The speaker wanted to turn up the volume, but Wall's precise blow drove his teeth into his throat. They beat him fiercely and with concentration, talking in hushed tones so that, God forbid, the neighbors and guards wouldn't hear. The blood splattering everywhere awakened my animal instinct to destroy. Pushing my cellmates aside, I approached the offender and said:

"Leave him to me, guys. I want to settle accounts with him."

\- Well, that's a completely fair wish.

Everyone stepped aside, and I began to pummel the dejected brazen fellow in the near-total darkness, truly enjoying it. After a good deal of punching, I knocked him to the floor and delivered several blows to the head with my heavy boots. He wheezed as if in his sleep, and the Doctor said, pulling me away:

"Okay then. Enough. This will teach him a good lesson. He'll learn how to behave in polite company."

Tired but happy, we climbed into our beds and fell asleep in no time...

The bell in the hallway rang sharply, signaling reveille. I struggled to open my eyes and shielded them with my hand until I adjusted to the bright light. I looked down and saw our replacement from yesterday on the floor, huddled in an unnatural position. A pool of dried blood had formed around his head. Remembering what had happened that night, I jumped off the bunk and moved the stiff body with my foot. Quite frightened, I began to shake the Doctor, who had a hard time waking up in the mornings. This time, he jumped up surprisingly quickly. The others woke up after him.

"What a pity," said the Doctor, feeling the deceased's pulse. "Must have been a heart attack." He looked at his cellmates and added reproachfully:

\- You didn't have to kick him in the head at all.

"What are you talking about?" Jojon interjected. "You weren't far behind, blizzarding him."

The Big Jew looked at me heavily and said:

\- It seems to me that he kicked the bucket from your blows, Alex.

I didn’t like the way the question was put, and I said angrily:

"Just don't try to blame me. Who started all this? Me? I joined you at the very last minute..."

“And he struck the final chord,” Jojon added sarcastically.

"If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut," I snapped. "Whose idea was it to teach him a lesson? Mine?"

One Wall continued to snore, turned to the wall.

"You'll wake up that music box," I said angrily. "After all, it was he who drove his teeth into his throat when the Big Jew pinned him to the bars."

"No one denies that we all gave him a little something to make him behave properly in the future," the Doctor said in a mentoring tone. "However, we didn't intend to kill him, and it was you, with the mindless fervor characteristic of youth, who dealt the fatal blow. I'm very sorry, kid, but you'll be the one answering for it."

"Traitors!" I exploded. "You are all vile traitors and lying, stinking ferrets!"

I realized that the story of two years ago was repeating itself, when my buddies had set me up, betrayed me, and handed me over to the cops. No, you can't trust anyone in this world! Jojon woke Wall, who, realizing what was happening, readily confirmed that Loudspeaker had died from my blows.

One by one, guards began to appear in the cell, then the senior guard, then the Governor himself—the warden. My accomplices vied with each other in describing how I had killed this defecation-pervert, who now lay like a bastard on the floor.

The next day, around eleven o'clock, the prison's frightened silence was broken by the excited voices of the senior warden, the Governor, and another very important-looking Chief. They paced the corridor several times, continuing the discussion they'd begun in the warden's office. Meanwhile, our all-powerful Governor respectfully repeated:

"But, sir... I'm sorry, but... Okay! But what do you want us to do?"

Finally, the entire group stopped in front of our cell, and the senior warden opened it. It wasn't hard to guess who was in charge. He was a tall, trim man, towering over the plump, round Governor by a full head. He had piercing, merciless, gray-blue eyes and a beautifully tailored suit of the same color. His demeanor exuded authority and self-confidence. Looking as if through us, he said in a well-placed voice:

"The government is no longer willing to tolerate outdated punishments. Group criminals together in a common pen, and you get social crime. And concentrated crime inevitably leads to reformatory crimes. An example of this is before you."

The Chief looked meaningfully in my direction and continued:

"But we'll break them out of this vicious cycle. We'll still need prisons for political opponents. Ordinary lawbreakers need to be treated on a purely medical basis, killing the very homicidal reflex within them. Complete rehabilitation within a year. You see, they fear neither punishment nor God's vengeance. That's why each one has several sentences. They enjoy their punishments, and they start killing each other."

There was something in his words that I really didn’t like, and since he couldn’t see me, I boldly objected:

"Excuse me, sir, but I disagree with you. For example, I'm not an ordinary criminal, not a professional one, so to speak, and I ended up here by pure misunderstanding. I'd say an unfortunate accident and unfortunate circumstances."

The chief warden turned red as a lobster and barked threateningly:

— Shut up, you idiot. Don't you see who you're talking to?

"It's all right, all right," Chief said condescendingly, then added, turning to the Governor, "He could be used as a pioneer. He's young, brazen, reckless, and vicious. Brodsky will take care of him tomorrow, and you'll witness a revolutionary experiment. Don't worry, everything will go perfectly. The young scoundrel will be transformed beyond recognition."

These decisive words became the first step towards my liberation.

  

That same evening, I was gently escorted, with kicks and slaps, to the holy of holies of the Pack—the Governor's office himself. As I was pushed inside, the Governor looked up from the papers lying before him on the desk and gazed at your humble servant for a long moment with the sad eyes of a sick spaniel.

"You don't have any idea what happened this morning, do you, 6655321?" he asked sadly, and without waiting for my answer, continued, "That steel ranger who visited us today was none other than the new Minister of the Interior. Having made all sorts of promises to the voters, he has zealously set about eradicating crime. A new broom sweeps in a new way. Well, this isn't a broom, but a steel scraper. He intends to introduce all sorts of newfangled gadgets everywhere, the latest scientific advances in the field of mental regulation and behavior modification. Personally, I strongly disapprove of this, but orders are orders. I'll be perfectly frank with you. If someone hits you, you'll hit back, won't you? Then why can't the state, whose laws you criminals constantly break, hit you back? Of course, I'm speaking figuratively, meaning that every crime must inevitably be punished. This has always been the case, among all peoples... And now they tell me: "No! The new concept requires turning the evil one into a kind, bloodthirsty wolf—into a humble lamb." Is this possible? Is it fair?

Deciding that the question was addressed to me and the Governor wanted to know my opinion, I cleared my throat and began in a polite tone:

\- Sir, if you want...

"Shut your mouth, you brat!" the senior warden standing next to the Governor barked. "Are you starting to be rude and boorish again?"

I clicked my teeth and shrugged indifferently.

"It's all right, Borman," the Governor reassured him, then turned to me wearily. "You, 6655321, will be re-educated. Tomorrow you'll be handed over to Dr. Brodsky. After two weeks of treatment using the new method, you'll be released. You'll cease to be a number and will go out into the big world as Alex. But what kind of Alex? Well, how? Does this prospect suit you?"

This time I prudently kept silent, but the enraged senior warden shouted again:

\- Answer, dirty piglet, when the Governor himself asks you.

I shrugged again and obediently answered:

— Yes, of course, sir. Thank you very much, sir. God knows I've tried to behave well here. I'm very grateful to everyone who worked on my rehabilitation.

I took a pen and hastily signed my sentence, afraid that he might change his mind.

"Well, boy. You chose your own destiny," the Governor said thoughtfully.

"The prison chaplain wanted to speak to him, sir," said the senior warder.

“Go ahead,” the Governor said, washing his hands.

Our chaplain sat behind his desk in his office. As I approached him, I smelled the pleasant scent of expensive whiskey and vodka. Seeing me, he perked up.

\- Ah, it's you, little 6655321! Come in, sit down.

He looked at me thoughtfully. I looked back expectantly. Then he spoke very sincerely and frankly:

"First of all, I wanted to tell you that I have nothing to do with this. If I could protest, I would definitely protest against what they want to do to you. But what is my feeble voice compared to the chorus of those in power?! And besides, it would mean the end of my career. I hope you understand me?"

I nodded, although I didn't really understand what he was getting at.

"There are very serious ethical issues involved here," the priest continued. "On the one hand, you'll be transformed into a very decent, docile young man. After this treatment, you'll never again have the desire to commit violence or disturb the peace in any other way. Do you understand everything?"

— Of course, sir. It will be wonderful to be virtuous again…

I said these words, but inside I was torn apart by laughter.

But then the chaplain began to say very strange things.

"Sometimes kindness is worse than theft. There are situations when kindness, non-resistance to evil, turns you into a criminal or, at best, an accomplice to a crime. This probably sounds paradoxical, especially coming from a servant of God. I still have many sleepless nights ahead of me. What does God ultimately need? Kindness as such, or the right to choose and voluntarily join the forces of good? A person who chooses Evil is, to a certain extent, better than someone forced into Good. These are deep philosophical and ethical categories, little 6655321. They are far from being explored. I can't explain them to you now, because I haven't fully grasped them myself. I just ask you to remember this, Alex-boy." If someday in the future you look back on this period of your life and remember me—a weak man and the most humble of God's servants—don't think that there was even a drop of evil in my heart or that I had a hand in this inhuman experiment... You will be deprived of the fundamental driving force of life, the force that allows you to feel alive—the eternal struggle between the good and evil within you. You will become a one-dimensional mechanism. And none of my prayers will help you, for you will be beyond my reach. This is a terrible thing, if you think about it. And yet, by agreeing to be deprived of ethical choice, you subconsciously strive to side with the forces of light. I would like to believe this, as I do that the Lord God will help us...

Having finished his sermon, which I didn't quite understand, the chaplain burst into tears, while I was overcome with uncontrollable laughter, and I could hardly restrain myself from laughing in his face. I attributed this fool's unexpected tears to the effects of the "White Horse," and I was probably not far from the truth. Without embarrassment, he pulled a half-empty bottle with a maned horse's head on the label from the counter and poured three fingers' worth of it into a dirty glass. After downing the whiskey in one gulp, he said, as if talking to himself:

"Or maybe everything will be alright and I'm worrying for nothing? God works in mysterious ways..."

The next morning, I said goodbye to the old Pack, and I did so with sadness, for it's sad to leave a place you've grown accustomed to, even one so vile. But I didn't go far, my friends. I was escorted to the white buildings right there on the prison grounds, not far from the sports field. The buildings were brand new, with a peculiar, cold smell that made me shiver involuntarily. Lost, I stood in the vast, uninviting, windowless, doorless hall, tasting the alien scents—a sterile mixture of hospital, new construction, and the unknown. A man in a white coat emerged from a hidden side door and silently signed a receipt, as if for a package. The guard who delivered me nodded in my direction, warning me:

"Be careful with this guy, Doc. He's still a rapist and murderer, even though he managed to approach our chaplain and was diligently poring over the Bible."

The doctor had cheerful, mocking blue eyes. When he spoke, his thin-lipped mouth stretched into an undecipherable smiley face. So, he said:

\- Oh, we won't misbehave anymore, will we, Alex? We'll be friends.

His face lit up with such a toothy, kind, open smile that I immediately warmed to him. The guard left, and my new friend handed me over to a less important man in a robe, who led me to a very nice, clean, bright bedroom with curtains on the windows and a table lamp on the nightstand. Left alone, I laughed joyfully, bouncing on the new springy mattress. What a lucky man you are, Alex!

They stripped me of my hideous prison uniform and gave me beautiful silk pajamas to match the bed linens. Over them, I pulled on a warm wool robe and felt slippers on my bare feet, still amazed at the good fortune that had befallen me. So far, I liked everything here. For the first time in months, a handsome orderly with the physique of a bodybuilder brought a huge cup of aromatic, steaming coffee and fresh newspapers. I devoured them greedily and didn't notice the first smiling man who had signed for my delivery entering the room.

“Aha, there you are!” he exclaimed with feigned cheerfulness, as if he’d only just found me. “My name is Doctor Branom. I’m Professor Brodsky’s assistant. With your permission, I’ll perform a routine medical examination.” He pulled a shiny stethoscope from his breast pocket. “I need to make sure you’re absolutely healthy… physically. Is that okay?”

Of course I would! I eagerly took off my pajama top and did everything the kind doc ordered, no, rather requested, me. Finally, curiosity got the better of me, and I asked:

\- What are you going to do with me, sir?

"Oh, nothing special," the doctor replied easily, running his stethoscope over my bare back like a miner with a mine detector. "Our method is very simple, like all ingenious things. We'll just show you films."

"Movies?" I asked, genuinely surprised. "You mean we're going to watch a regular movie?"

“Not exactly,” Branom answered calmly. “These are very specific films. The first showing is after lunch.” He patted my shoulder encouragingly. “You’re a perfectly healthy young man. You’ve just lost a little weight on the prison food, if you can call it that. Well, no matter, we’ll feed you up. You can put on your pajamas.” He sat down on the edge of the bed. “After each meal, we’ll give you an injection to help restore your strength.”

A warm wave of gratitude washed over me toward this man, pleasant in every way. I smiled knowingly and asked:

— Probably some vitamins, sir?

— Uh-huh... Something like that. One injection in the arm after breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The doctor left, and I lay down on the cool, crisp sheets, feeling like I was on cloud nine, and began flipping through Worldsport, Sinny's (a movie news magazine), and Goal. After flipping through the magazines, I closed my eyes blissfully and sank into dreams of how great it would be when I got out. I'd find some easy day job, since my education was complete. I'd form a new gang and first thing I did was get those scumbags—Kyrus and Pete, if the Coppolas haven't already nabbed them. This time I'll be more careful so I don't get caught again. Good people are giving me a chance, despite the murder and all. It would be stupid if they caught me again after treating me with all these movies, which will make me a good boy again. In my heart I laughed at the naivety of all these well-wishers and could not hide my smile from ear to ear when the same “bodybuilder” brought breakfast on a tray for His Majesty Alexander the Great.

The orderly looked at me inquiringly and said:

— It's nice to see a happy person.

He set the tray down and silently left. After the prison grub, I had before me the food of the gods: three generous slices of piping-hot roast beef, mashed potatoes with vegetables, fruit ice cream, and a huge cup of strong, steaming tea. On the tray there was even an expensive sack of tar and a box of matches with only one match. Now that's the life! Now that's what I call it!

About half an hour later, as I lay relaxed on my bed, rapturously picking my teeth with a match, a pretty young woman entered the room. She was wearing a white robe, cinched at her slim waist with a belt. And what breasts she had! I had never seen such breasts in my two years in prison. In her hands she carried a shiny tray with a filled syringe on it.

— Here are the vitamins! Maybe you could give me an injection in the butt, baby?

She didn't react at all. She impassively stuck the needle into my left arm and headed for the door, teasing me with her shapely legs. As soon as she left, my nurse appeared with a stretcher-trolley. This surprised me, and I asked:

"Listen, buddy. Why a wheelchair? I can get around just fine on my own two feet."

“No, it’s better for you to lie down here, boy,” the nurse objected.

And indeed, when I got out of bed, I felt a strange weakness and dizziness. "The damned mines," I thought, struggling to get onto the cart, "have sapped Iron Alex's strength. Oh well! The vitamins will quickly help me regain my former form. Now let's watch a movie."

  

I was wheeled into the most unusual movie theater I'd ever seen. True, one wall was a large silk screen, and in the opposite wall, two square embrasures gaped like black mouths, from which projector tubes protruded. Stereo speakers were dotted everywhere, just like the ones I have at home. But that's where the resemblance to a typical movie theater ended. On the right wall, there was a panel with a multitude of different sensors, gauges, and indicators, from which a web of all sorts of wires stretched toward the center of the room. In the center of the room, opposite the screen, stood a solitary chair, reminiscent of a dentist's chair. With some help from a nurse, I climbed out of the wheelchair and sat down in this terrifying chair. Turning my head nervously from side to side, I noticed small windows with frosted glass beneath the embrasures, behind which someone was coughing cautiously: "Cough-cough-cough..." "What's happening to me?" flashed through my mind. "It must be the effect of switching to rich foods and vitamins."

"I'll leave you for a while," the nurse said. "Sit still. The session will begin in a few minutes, as soon as Dr. Brodsky arrives." He gave a strange smile. "I hope you enjoy the film."

To tell you the truth, my friends, I had no time for movies anymore. All I wanted was to crush my pillow for about six hundred minutes. I really didn't like my half-suspended, half-conscious state. From somewhere out of the darkness, a stranger in a white coat materialized, singing some tacky hit. He unceremoniously strapped my head to the headrest so that I couldn't turn it, and I sat there, staring at the screen like a ram at a new gate.

“And what is this for?!” I protested.

Medman stopped humming his stupid song for a minute and patiently explained that this was done so that I would not turn my face away from the screen.

"But why should I turn him away?" I asked, genuinely surprised. "After all, I voluntarily agreed to watch the movie. I love him very much..."

Then another medic (there were three of them, including the girl manipulating the controls on the dashboard) let out an unpleasant laugh and said ambiguously:

"Depends on the movie." Then, catching himself, he added, "Don't worry, man. That's how it has to be."

And then they deftly strapped my arms and legs to the armrests and legs of the chair. Then they angled it at a forty-five degree angle to the screen. It was all curious and very strange. Oh well, whatever! Let them do what they want. As long as they let me out in a couple of weeks, as they promised. However, what I disliked most was when they started attaching some sensors to me, and then, using strong clamps, pulled the skin from my forehead to the back of my head. My eyelids drooped, and my eyes bulged like those of a frozen pike perch. Now I couldn't close my eyes, no matter how hard I tried. I forced a laugh and remarked:

— It must be some really cool movie if you're so worried about me watching it.

"You're right, man," one of the medics laughed in response. "It's a great horror movie. I hope you like it."

Here they put a steel helmet with a lot of wires on my head, and on my stomach they installed a suction cup with a metronome and a thick cable, the end of which was lost somewhere on the panel.

Finally, all the preparations were complete, and some important-looking person entered the room. I realized this by the sudden silence of the medical staff's voices. And then I saw Dr. Brodsky for the first time. He was a short, plump man with a huge, half-naked, half-curly head. Large horn-rimmed glasses perched on a dark-burgundy, turkey-like nose. The doctor was wearing a beautiful suit that concealed all the drobex of his figure, and there was a very distinctive smell of barbershop and operating room. Dr. Branham, who entered with him, smiled encouragingly at me.

"Is everything ready?" Dr. Brodsky asked in a commanding tone.

Affirmative responses came from all sides, and immediately the faint hum of numerous instruments could be heard. The lights in the hall went out completely, and your humble narrator stared dumbfounded at the illuminated screen, unable to move or tear his gaze away. And then, my friends and brothers, the film began, accompanied by a deafening cacophony of dissonant music, an avalanche of sound that rained down upon me from every loudspeaker. Frames without titles or credits flashed before my eyes.

Night. A deserted street, like any city. Ragged streetlamps glow brightly. Ominous music creates an atmosphere of uncontrollable fear, giving way to bestial terror. An old, hunched man wanders the streets, and suddenly, out of nowhere, two young men pounce on him and begin methodically beating him. A close-up of his face, distraught with pain and fear, streaming bright red blood. Everything looks very natural, as if filmed with a hidden camera.

The groans emanating from the loudspeakers, the screams of the man being beaten, and the fierce snorting of the hooligans further heighten the effect. The frolicking boys, in whom I imagine Kir and Josh, turn the poor old man into a bloody mess before my eyes, completing their dirty work with blows of hobnailed boots on the lifeless body. The chilling crunch of bones. The killers throw the corpse (I have no doubt that it is a corpse) into a roadside ditch and quickly flee. The final shot of this episode captures the corpse's disfigured face.

From the very first frames of this, so to speak, film, a disgusting sensation began to slowly build deep within me—as if I'd swallowed a slippery, cold toad and it was floating around in my stomach. I attributed this strange sensation to prolonged malnutrition and my stomach's inability to cope with rich, fatty foods and the vitamins I'd taken the day before. I tried to suppress the new sensation and turned my attention to the second scene, which immediately followed the first. Now the same boys had caught a young girl somewhere and, having ripped off her clothes, were taking turns performing the familiar "back and forth, back and forth" on her. More and more boys were rushing in from somewhere, and she kept going around and around in a circle, sobbing and crying for help. But her friends only laughed merrily, enjoying her suffering. The poor girl's inhuman cries seemed to flow directly into my soul. They were accompanied by tragic symphonic music. It all looked so natural, I couldn't help but think it must be documentary footage or a masterful montage. In any case, none of the actors would have agreed to play something like this. At that moment, when the girl began her sixth or seventh brutal battle and her heart-rending screams began to echo through the loudspeakers again, I felt truly sick. The pain that had been building inside exploded and filled every cell of my body. I jerked, but the straps held tight. I wanted to vomit their vile breakfast, but I couldn't. After this episode, Dr. Brodsky's harsh, unpleasant voice rang out, dispassionately stating: "The response coefficient is above twelve and a half. Not bad. Not bad at all."

The next frame appeared on the screen. This time it was simply a human face, deathly pale and yet alive. Before my eyes, it was undergoing a horrific transformation. Someone behind the screen was tormenting its victim with sadistic pleasure. I was sweating profusely. The already unbearable pain became even more intense. I desperately needed a drink; it felt like my tongue was stuck in my throat. I couldn't bear it anymore. If only I could turn away from the screen! Then my torture would end. But I couldn't even close my eyes. My insides rebelled, and I began to hiccup and belch as I saw the razor slash first across one eye, and it slowly oozed out, then the other... Then it began to cut my cheeks, lips, nose... Bright scarlet blood splashed into the camera, it seemed right in my face, and I physically felt its warmth. But that was not all. Someone invisible began to twist my teeth with pliers. The shared agony was a mixture of terrible pain (mine and the victim's), groans, sobs, wheezing, sweat, tears, and blood, blood, blood...

From somewhere far away, the calm, satisfied voice of the chief executioner penetrated my clouded consciousness: “Excellent! Magnificent! Even better than I expected!” The next segment of this endless film vividly reminded me of an episode from my past life: a group of riotous teenagers, in a frenzied frenzy, were smashing the shop of some helpless old woman. In the old days, we called this shopping. The woman was crawling in a pool of her own blood, dragging her broken leg behind her, like an old bird dragging a broken wing. Having smashed everything they could, the merry boys set the shop on fire, and I saw the agonized face of its owner as she was burned alive, and I even smelled the smell of charred human flesh. Then I couldn’t take it anymore and screamed at the top of my lungs:

— I feel sick! I feel fucking sick… Let me puke somewhere!

"It's all fine. It's just you. The final episode is about to begin," they reassured me, and laughter rang out in the audience.

If this was humor, I'd call it black, as the screen began showing the most sophisticated torture methods used by the Japanese during World War II. I saw soldiers nailed to trees with fires lit beneath their feet. I saw their genitals cut off and their heads chopped off with short samurai swords, and they rolled and rolled, still making bloodcurdling sounds. Blood spurted from their decapitated bodies, and the Japanese laughed as they took souvenir photos...

"Stop it! Please stop it! I can't take it anymore!" I begged, feeling like I was about to pass out.

"Stop it? Why, Alex-boy? We've only just begun," Dr. Brodsky's mocking voice rang out, and the others laughed like those Japanese...

  

Finally the film ended, and the Chief Sadist said, rubbing his fat little hands with satisfaction:

— That's enough for the first time. What do you think, Branom?

Handsome Branom just smiled his meek, bright smile.

"Well, that's good," Brodsky said. "You can take the patient to his room." He came up to me and patted me on the shoulder in a fatherly way. "Everything's going great, man. A very promising start."

Dr. Branom gave me an "I-have-nothing-to-do-with" smile, and now I didn't know what to make of him. They untied me, removed the iron band from my splitting head and the horrible clamps from my inflamed eyes. They transferred me to a wheelchair, and the medic wheeled me down the long corridors, humming some tawdry tune about "Pretty Mary."

"Shut up before I give you a good whack!" I barked irritably. He only condescendingly patted me on the shoulder and began singing even louder. I felt utterly obscene, like I'd been raped, and I screamed, pouring out all my contempt for this white-coated bastard.

After that, I felt better. They washed me, changed my clothes, and put me to bed. They brought me a large cup of strong tea with cream and a lot of sugar.

It must have been a nightmare, and none of this happened to me...

Dr. Branom entered the room timidly, his face radiating kindness.

"So, how are we doing, my friend?" he asked cheerfully. "By my calculations, you should have gotten back to normal by now."

"That's according to your..." I muttered, offended. Pretending not to notice my hostile tone, Branom sat down on the edge of the bed and said enthusiastically:

"Dr. Brodsky is very pleased with you. You've had an amazingly positive response, with a very high response rate. Two sessions are scheduled for tomorrow: morning and evening," he told me cheerfully. "Of course, you'll feel dreadful by the end of the day. But there's nothing to be done. You'll have to be patient if you want to cure your violence syndrome. Fight fire with fire, you know... The main thing is to develop immunity to aggression."

"Have you completely lost your mind?!" I exclaimed indignantly. "Are you really trying to force me to watch this pornography twice a day? For God's sake! It's terrible!"

"Of course it's terrible!" Dr. Branom agreed with a smile. "But you used to think differently, didn't you? These are the first fruits of your treatment. You've realized that any violence is terrible. Gradually, you'll develop a physical aversion to it. Your entire body will rebel at the mere thought of violence."

"I'm starting to feel sick just watching these horrible scenes. I've never experienced anything like this before. Quite the opposite. I don't understand anything..."

"Life is an amazing thing," Dr. Branom declared with a prophetic voice. "Who can fully comprehend the hidden meaning of life's phenomena and processes, the secret mechanics and unexplored potential of the human organism? Dr. Brodsky is, of course, a remarkable man, and his method is a great achievement of human genius. What is happening to you is what should happen to any normal, mentally and physically healthy human being in the face of the forces of Evil, which espouse the principle of destruction. We are pulling you to the side of Good, and we will, whether you like it or not..."

"Why the hell do I need this kind of treatment if it's making me feel worse and worse?" I asked, genuinely indignant.

"To recover, you need to get over the illness. Purification through suffering. It's all quite logical and in the spirit of Christian morality."

He stood up, patted me on the leg encouragingly, and left me alone with my doubts. According to him, all those vile films, drugs, and machines were for my own good. I still haven't quite decided whether to resist tomorrow when they try to hook me up or inject me, put on a fancy fight, or resign myself to my fate. And really, who are they to determine my fate?

  

— Stop it! Finish it! Stop it! — I screamed like a madman. — I can’t take it anymore! Have mercy!

It happened the next day, and though I'd tried to be a model, obedient boy all morning, I finally couldn't stand it and began cursing my tormentors with the most slum-like obscenities, completely oblivious to the presence of a woman in the room. Just like during the first session, I sat chained to the torture chair, forced to stare at the screen as brutally graphic images flashed across the room. At first, there was nothing frightening about them. Several cheerful young men were wildly ransacking a shop, stuffing their pockets with money and other odds and ends, and bleeding the feebly resisting elderly Jewish woman who owned it. But when blood began to flow from her broken mouth, nose, and ears, I experienced the ominous symptoms that had plagued me for the past 24 hours. Gradually, they developed into unbearable pain, and I thrashed in the chair, trying in vain to free myself.

"Excellent! Top notch!" Dr. Brodsky rejoiced, ignoring the curses directed at him. "Everything is going as it should. Just a little more and we'll be finished."

Images of German war newsreels, preceded by swastikas, banners, and a rapacious eagle, flashed before my eyes. Arrogant, haughty Nazi geese strode through the smoky streets of bombed-out cities. Plump, smug goons, wielding rifle butts, drove the few terrified inhabitants from the ruins. Now they stood naked at the edge of a ditch and fell into it, mown down by machine-gun fire—women, children, the elderly. Brutal soldiers finished off the wounded and dragged them into the ditch with hooks… Walking skeletons… smoking crematorium ovens greedily swallowed more and more victims… piles of human bones… smiling German burghers fertilizing fields with human ashes… souvenirs made of skulls and genuine human skin…

I'm rushing around, suffocating, as if I'm being shot, burned, my skin being peeled off... All these barbaric scenes are accompanied by the loud music of my favorite Ludwig Ivan Beethoven, I think his "Fifth Symphony." And this is doubly terrifying. Blasphemers! I'm indignant and scream angrily:

— Stop this right now, you fiends of hell! Fascists! Nothing is sacred to you. This is a sin, a sin, a sin!

Another minute or two. The swastika appears on the screen again, and in large letters: "THE END."

The lights came on and Dr. Brodsky and Dr. Branom approached me. Brodsky looked puzzled.

\- What were you squealing about about sin, boy?

"And the fact that you have no right to use Beethoven's divine music in your vile films," I reply angrily, swallowing the disgusting, bitter saliva. "He didn't harm anyone. He simply wrote amazing music."

Then I felt really bad, and they quickly brought me a kidney-shaped vessel.

"Music, you say," Brodsky said thoughtfully. "I didn't know you were a music lover. No wonder I'm amazed at your unusually high response rate. So music can be a useful and very effective emotional stimulant. How did we lose sight of that, Bran?"

"It can't be helped, kid," Branom said. "Every man kills what he loves, as the philosopher said. Maybe that's why we're so cruel and heartless towards our loved ones. Perhaps there's an element of punishment in this. God's punishment, if you will..."

— Enough philosophizing! For God's sake, give me something to drink.

"Untie him," Dr. Brodsky ordered, "and bring him some cold lime juice."

I was released, and I drank ice-cold juice and water for a long time, still unable to get enough. Dr. Brodsky, watching me with interest, remarked:

"You're quite an intelligent young man, Alex. And not without taste. How can you reconcile two such contradictory things: violence and music? Although the most notorious fascist criminals also considered themselves intelligent people and adored classical music... Yes, violence and robbery: the second as an aspect of the first..."

I remained silent, gradually coming to my senses.

"By the way, how do you feel about our treatment plan? What do you think we're doing to you?"

"You're making me suffer by showing me these sadistic films," I blurted out. "I suspect the films aren't the only ones to blame. However, I'm sure I'll stop being sick as soon as you stop showing me them."

And then it dawned on me! How hadn't I figured this out before? Of course! It was all the fault of those "vitamins" they insisted on giving me after every meal.

"Now I get it, you dirty liars!" I cried. "How vile of you to play such inhuman tricks on me! Well, now I won't fall for your bait. From now on, no more injections!"

"I was waiting for you to broach this subject," Dr. Brodsky said calmly. "Let's agree once and for all. We can administer Ludovico to you in various ways. For example, orally in pill form or mixed into food. But subcutaneous administration is the most effective. And don't resist it... if you want to be cured and released as soon as possible. If I were you, I'd cooperate with us in everything... Two weeks and twelve years. Think about it!"

"You treacherous bastards," I whispered barely audibly. "You're backing me into a corner. To hell with you! I don't mind your brutal methods. Just leave the music alone. It would be the height of injustice if I died every time I listened to Ludwig Ivan, Handel, and the rest. You may be unprincipled bastards with no sacred values, but I will never forgive you for this."

They pondered my words tensely. These brontosauruses were impenetrable. Finally, Dr. Brodsky spoke:

"Determining that one true line is the hardest thing of all. There's only one world, and only one life. Even the most godly deeds are sometimes connected to violence. And such lofty categories as Love and Music are no exception. Take, for example, the liberation act itself. You'll have to take a risk, there's nothing you can do about it... You've made your choice, boy."

I didn’t quite understand all these subtleties, but I hastened to agree:

"You needn't continue, sir." I decided to sing along and see what would happen. "You've convinced me that all this dratsing, cruelty, and ultraviolence are a terrible crime against humanity. I've learned your lesson, sirs. You opened my eyes, and I'm cured, thank God..."

I was reveling in my eloquence, imagining Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King in one person, but my rant was interrupted by Dr. Brodsky’s corrosive, incredulous laughter:

"To listen to you, you're the spitting image of a repentant Magdalene," the doctor said mockingly (why do they always compare me to that biblical whore?). "You're right: repentance is an important moral and ethical category. But you're not ready for it yet. Let us decide what's best for you... But chin up, kid. You're on the road to rehabilitation, and in less than two weeks you'll be transformed into a completely new person. And not through some abstract repentance, but thanks to the latest advances in medical science."

He said "two weeks," but that, my friends and brothers, felt like a century. In that time, I've traveled the entire human race, from the creation of the world to its distant future. I swear on my mother, fourteen years in the Pack would have felt like a sanatorium compared to what I've been through over these damned Fortnite games.

The scenes repeated themselves with compelling consistency: rape, torture, concentration camps, shootings, and all manner of executions, including hangings, beheadings, and dismemberments. With each passing day, my revulsion grew, and I wanted to die rather than see it all. One morning, I couldn't take it anymore and tried to get my thugs to stop me. I ran and slammed my head into the wall. But even then, they prevailed, as I witnessed the violence against myself as if from a distance and immediately began throwing the steaks I'd eaten for breakfast.

Two days later, I woke up, surprisingly, without my usual headache. I wolfed down eggs, toast, and thick tea, and patiently waited for the nurse with her damn syringe. By my rough estimate, I had no more than three days left until the end of the two-week period. I could handle it! I wouldn't die in spite of them all!

Time passed, and the bitch in the gown still didn't show up. Instead, a smiling nurse entered the room and said with a pleasant smile:

\- Today, my friend, you will go on your own.

"Go? Where are you going?" I asked in surprise.

"The usual place," he replied, amused by my genuine bewilderment. "Yes, yes. Don't be surprised. You'll go to today's show yourself. I'll accompany you, of course, but wheelchairs are out of the question from now on."

— What about this hyper-shit injection?

I was really amazed, because they attached great importance to the Ludovico modifier.

"This procedure is over," the nurse chuckled. "Perhaps you're against it? Oh, you're not? Well, look... Now it's all up to you. True, for the first time we'll strap you to the torture chair... Just in case... and then we'll see. So, are you coming?"

I threw on a robe, slipped my feet into soft slippers and boldly walked into the abode of the Marquis de Sade.

During this screening, I was intently paying attention to my own sensations. From the very first scene of violence (a platoon of rabid SS men graphically slaughtering a Polish family, brutally raping a mother and her three young daughters in front of their crucified father and brothers), I experienced the usual symptoms: dark circles before my eyes, nausea, terrible spasms, and a terrible burning sensation in my mouth. Unable to tear myself away from the screen, I was nonetheless acutely aware that this time all of this was happening to me naturally, and not under the influence of Ludovico's stuff. Had they really infected me with this filth for the rest of my life? Bastards! Bastards! Fascists!

This revelation made me cry like a little baby, but the MSDMs quickly jumped up to me and wiped away my tears with handkerchiefs so that, God forbid, I wouldn’t miss the atrocities happening on the screen.

After the horrific discovery, I fell into a deep depression. Lying in bed at night, I cursed my careless agreement to undergo this inhumane experiment. I would have been better off serving my time in my dear, beloved Pack. "No, I have to do something before they finish me off completely. Surely there must be some way out?" I frantically ran through my escape plans. I had nothing I could use as a weapon. They had prudently confiscated all cutting and piercing objects. Every morning, a fat, bald man shaved me, but he was always accompanied by two burly Brothers of Mercy, vigilantly monitoring my every move. My nails were cut short to prevent scratching (it's a good thing they hadn't filed my teeth!). But I hadn't lost my fighting skills yet and could easily have knocked out a couple of the guards. Finally, a seemingly good idea occurred to me. I climbed out of the bed, walked up to the door, and started pounding on it loudly with my fists, screaming like crazy: "Oh, someone help! For God's sake! I'm sick, I'm dying. Help!" I almost went hoarse when, finally, I heard footsteps outside the door and the grumpy voice of the nurse who usually brought me food.

— What's going on here? What are you thinking of in the middle of the night?

— I'm d-i-i-i-ving! — I groaned. — I have a terrible pain in my side. I'm afraid it's appendicitis. Oh-oh-oh!

He entered the room cautiously, looking around in confusion. I crouched behind the door, determined not to miss my chance. Taking a step forward, I raised my "duck," intending to hit him in the back of the head, and suddenly vividly imagined him writhing on the floor before I could finish the job with my feet... and then a wave of uncontrollable pain and uncontrollable fear washed over me, and I began to convulse as if I were having a seizure. Staggering and belching, I took a few steps toward the bed and collapsed onto it, feeling as if I were about to die.

My guard, wearing a nightcap and a long shirt, looked at me with malicious curiosity, perfectly understanding what was happening to me, and said mockingly:

"Let this be another lesson to you, you hornless goat. Well, why are you so sad? Get up and hit me. That's what you had in mind, wasn't it, you stinking bastard? Here's my jaw. Strike it!"

He leaned his grinning face over me, but I couldn't move my arm or leg without causing myself excruciating pain.

"Shit! Now you're a piece of shit!" the orderly said contemptuously.

He grabbed me by the chest, lifted me up like a limp rag doll, and slapped me loudly across the face, saying:

\- This is for pulling me out of bed in the middle of the night.

He rubbed his hands with satisfaction, walked out, and clicked the key. I hurried to hide in my sleep, and my last thought was that it would be better to be beaten myself than to raise a hand against someone.

I dreamed that I was turning the other cheek to the offender.

  

I couldn't believe my ears, my friends, when they said that. I thought the two weeks they kept harping on about would never end. And then suddenly...

"We're letting you out tomorrow, boy. That's what Dr. Brodsky said." The man who'd slapped me one night pointed his thumb upward, as if it were heaven and God himself lived there. "But today you'll face one more, final test. Something like a final exam."

He grinned maliciously and made a mysterious face. I no longer cared. I prepared to head into the chamber of horrors, as usual, in pajamas and slippers. But no! This time they gave me my casual clothes—carefully washed and ironed. But the most surprising thing was that they even returned my razor—a faithful companion on my nocturnal adventures in the old days.

I concentrated on changing, trying to guess what other nasty thing they had in store for me. I was led into a noticeably transformed room. The torture chair had been removed, and in its place were about twenty comfortable, soft chairs. In the semi-darkness, I noticed that most of them were occupied by the public, among whom were many familiar faces: the leader of Pack 84F (aka the Governor), the red-faced chaplain, the head guard, and even that Big Chief—the impeccably dressed Minister of the Interior. A few other people were flitting among the white coats, but I didn't recognize them.

Among them, Doc Brodsky and Branom strolled languidly, dressed like birthday boys. It was their big day, and they were happily playing the part of gracious hosts.

When I was brought in, Dr. Brodsky (who looked more like a successful businessman) spread his plump arms wide and joyfully said:

"And here, gentlemen, is the subject of our research. The product, so to speak, of our hard work." He placed his hand on my shoulder and explained, like a guide in a cabinet of curiosities: "As you can see, he is alert, healthy, and well-fed. We invited him here straight from a normal nine-hour sleep and a hearty breakfast, without any preliminary medication or hypnotic influence. Tomorrow we will confidently return him to the wider world, fully guaranteeing his integrity and goodwill towards others. In two weeks, we have achieved what a normal prison could not have achieved in two years, and would hardly have achieved in the entire fourteen years of his sentence. Well, enough words. Actions speak louder than words. So, to the point. Now you will see for yourself. Light!"

The lights in the theater went out, and I stood there, stunned, in the spotlight against the backdrop of the screen. Suddenly, a second spotlight picked out from the darkness the figure of a healthy man I'd never seen before, emerging from nowhere. He had a fleshy, mustachioed face and sparse hairs that seemed glued to his bald scalp. He looked to be thirty, forty, or fifty years old. Who the hell knows. In a word, old. He brazenly approached me, followed by the spotlight, and brazenly declared:

"Hello, dung heap. What's that smell coming off you? Do you only wash on holidays?"

I nearly choked with indignation, as I'd just been washing myself the day before, when this faggot, dancing up to me, stepped painfully, first on my left foot, then on my right. Then, out of nowhere, he stuck his thumb up my nose, bringing tears to my eyes. Continuing to mock me, this bastard grabbed my ear and started twisting it like a telephone dial. The audience in the hall laughed, watching this scene. Your humble servant, however, was in no mood for laughter. My nose and ear were burning, and I politely asked:

"Why are you making fun of me, brother? I haven't done anything bad to you. And anyway, I'm seeing you for the first time..."

"Oh, that..." the man chuckled disgustingly. "I'm doing this (his two stinking fingers dug into my poor nose) simply because (he pulled painfully on my long-suffering ear) I can't stand jerks like you... Well, try to do something to me. Try, you cowardly jackal."

I had a passionate urge to punch him in the face or rip his insolent grin from ear to ear with a razor. At the same time, I knew I had to do it quickly, before the nauseating wave that had been instilled in me washed over me. But as soon as I put my hand in my pocket, anticipating the pleasure with which I would slash his throat, a horrific image from the film he had shown me flashed through my mind—with blood, groans, a bleeding eye—and a terrible attack of pain and despair began. To stop it, I began frantically rummaging through my pockets, searching for something with which to appease this insolent man: cigarettes, or money, or something else... But my pockets were empty. There was nothing in them except the razor, and I humbly pulled it out and handed it to this terrible, laughing man, humbly pleading:

"For God's sake, my good man, let me do something for you. Here, take my razor. It's very good, sharp... A small gift... If you'd be so kind... please..."

"Keep your cheap bribes for yourself. You can't buy me with that, you dirty bastard," my assailant said, hitting my outstretched hand.

The razor fell with a clatter onto the mosaic floor.

— Well, please, let me do something for you. Would you like me to clean your shoes? Look, I can lick them until they shine.

And, oh people, believe it or not, I got down on all fours, stuck my tongue out half a meter, and began greedily licking his dirty, stinking boots. However, instead of gratitude, the bastard gave me a gentle kick in the face. The pain inside me subsided somewhat, and I took the risk of grabbing his legs and yanking them hard. He let out a frightened yelp and collapsed to the floor like a sack of shit, to the delighted laughter of the audience. Immediately, the pain in my head and guts awakened, and I quickly extended my hand, helping him to his feet. Meng became truly angry and swung to smash my defenseless face, but then Dr. Brodsky intervened:

\- Good! That's enough!

The terrifying man immediately lowered his hand and bowed like an actor after a successful performance. A bright light came on, blinding me. I stood there, mindlessly clapping my eyes in front of the excitedly buzzing audience, unable to comprehend what had happened to me.

As the master host of this unprecedented show, Dr. Brodsky stepped forward and addressed the assembled crowd with the following words:

"As you have just seen for yourselves, gentlemen, our client is forced to do good due to his, paradoxical as it may sound, predisposition to violence. Every bout of aggression is accompanied by intense physical discomfort, and so he immediately switches to the opposite reaction. Anyone have any questions?"

"What about the right to choose?" the chaplain's deep bass voice rang out. "You've deprived him of his God-given right, leaving him with purely selfish motives and impulses. Fear of physical pain reduces him to the utmost level of self-abasement. The insincerity of his actions is obvious. He's no longer a transgressor, not a criminal, since you've completely deprived him of the concept of transgression or crime. You've reduced the human right of moral choice to a basic animal instinct!"

"Let's not translate a purely medical, scientific attempt to suppress crime into the realm of moral and ethical categories," Dr. Brodsky retorted calmly. "We were given a specific task..."

"Which you successfully resolved," the minister intervened. "Congratulations, gentlemen. This is a true revolution in jurisprudence."

“Which is not even a hint here,” the Governor muttered, I think.

“I think it’s absolutely amazing,” someone interjected.

And then everyone started talking at once, as if they'd broken free, trying to convince their neighbors and ignoring all arguments. They seemed to have forgotten about me, paying no more attention to me than to an empty chair. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and shouted loudly:

— And me?! What about me now? What am I to you... a thing or a dog?

They fell silent as if on cue, and then all of a sudden they pounced on your humble narrator, hurling some nasty, angry words in my face. I shouted, offended:

\- Why did you make a clockwork orange out of me?!

I don't even know why those exact words came to mind, but everyone immediately shut up and remained stupefied for a minute or two. Then some puny, professorial-looking fellow stood up. He had a completely bald, seemingly self-contained head, like a billiard ball, connected to his body by a long, writhing neck woven from cables, wires, and cords. So this is what this goose said:

"You have no one to blame but yourself, boy. You made your own choice, everything else is just the consequences."

Here our prison chaplain cried out bitterly from his seat:

\- Oh, how I wish it were true!

From the way the Governor looked at him, one could unmistakably say that he would never occupy the post he was aiming for.

The heated argument spontaneously resumed, and suddenly I distinctly heard the word "Love," ringing out like a small change dropped to the floor. The chaplain, now furious (he'd obviously had a few too many drinks that morning), began crossing everyone and trumpeting, as if from a pulpit:

— All-consuming and all-forgiving Love will conquer universal primordial Fear and Alienation, and may Good be done without bitterness and not for the sake of self-interest...

Apparently, the old man had completely lost his mind with grief. They hissed at him, and then the guide-cum-master of ceremonies, Brodsky, stepped forward again:

"I'm glad, gentlemen, that you've touched on the eternal theme of Love. Now I'll demonstrate to you that special variety of it that's been dead since the time of Shakespeare and Petrarch, sunk into oblivion along with their Juliet and Beatrice."

He gestured with his plump little hand. The lights in the hall dimmed, and a spotlight flickered on, groping in the darkness and picking out your poor friend and storyteller. And suddenly, into the spotlight's radiant circle, the most youthful, tender, and beautiful woman I'd ever seen stepped out of the darkness. She had such wonderful, perky breasts, visible through her translucent, airy dress, that a delicious spasm gripped my instantly inflamed loins, and something struck me in the head. She seemed to be flying above the floor, her graceful foot barely touching it. I'd seen that gentle, sweet, innocent smile somewhere before. It seemed as if she'd descended from the heavens to me, and I wanted to have her right then and there. I had already taken a step toward her, ready to lay her out on the floor in my usual barbaric manner, but a sharp pain ripped through my guts, appearing like a vigilant detective around the corner, ready to cuff me. Subconsciously trying to avoid arrest, I instantly cast aside the thought of the irrepressible bliss of rapping, fell to one knee before her, and uttered the most insane words in the world:

"Oh, most beautiful and lovely of earthly creatures! Allow me to cast my weary heart at your divine feet. I would offer you all the roses in the world, but they are nothing compared to your beauty. If there were stormy weather right now, I would spread my cloak before you, unworthy of your footsteps..."

As I uttered these idiotic words, which came out of my mouth against my will, as if the devil himself had whispered them, I felt with relief how the pain gradually receded.

"Allow me," I shouted with even greater enthusiasm, "to worship you, my deity, and to be your protector and defender in this cruel world..." I carefully searched for the most correct, most heartfelt words to end the pain before it ended me. "Allow me to be your faithful knight, oh divine one."

With these words, I prostrated myself and kissed the hem of her dress.

And then it all ended, as if it were a film set in the Middle Ages. The lights came up, and my goddess bowed, beaming dazzling smiles into the audience and completely ignoring me. It was worth it to rant and rave like that in front of some hired extra, who could easily have been filmed by anyone present... except me.

"He will be a devout, God-fearing Christian," Dr. Brodsky continued commenting. "If he's slapped on one cheek, he'll turn the other. He'd rather be crucified than crucify. Now he wouldn't hurt a fly..."

He was absolutely right about that, my friends, because at that moment I actually thought it, and immediately, deep inside, a nasty little worm of fear began to stir and a butterfly of pain fluttered. I quickly pushed the thought aside, imagining myself feeding a fly sugar and tending to it as if it were a wounded beloved dog.

"Absolute transformation!" Dr. Brodsky exclaimed, promoting his product (that is, your humble servant). "Now he won't disgrace us, not only in freedom, but even beyond the gates of heaven!"

"The future will tell what kind of angel he'll turn out to be," the Minister cooled his ardor. "At least for now, it's working great."

"Oh, yes!" the chaplain beamed, remembering his career. "It works, and that's the main thing! May God help us all!"

# Part III  

\- Well, what next?

This sacramental question gnawed at my brain as I stood at the gates of Pack 84F the next morning. I was wearing my old outfit, the one I'd been caught in two years ago. In my hands, I held a black plastic bag with a skull and crossbones against a backdrop of a pack of 'Evil Tumors,' a syringe, and a pot-bellied bottle of Dimple. A few coins jingled in my pocket, the kindly administration having given me "for the beginning of a New Life."

After my "final exam," I was fed up with the various cameramen and women filming me and recording my voice for TV news. The savvy reporters conducted bogus interviews to publish in the newspapers the next day.

I was pretty tired of all this publicity and view-city and barely made it to the bed. It seemed like less than three minutes had passed when they jostled me awake and told me it was already morning and I could go wherever I wanted, never to come back here again. Everyone was eager to get me out as quickly as possible. They didn't even feed me breakfast, the bastards. They gave me a cup of tea, shoved a meager bag with my few belongings, a little money to keep me from starving at first, and then kicked me in the ass. Now I was not only a clockwork orange to them, but a squeezed lemon.

For now, I've decided to go home, make Mom and Dad happy, and cuddle up with their Bubzas. I'll come home, eat everything in the fridge, lie down on my comfortable bed, turn on the stereo—the joy of my youth—and at the same time think about what to do next with my absurd life.

So, one bus to downtown, another to Kingsley Avenue, and here I am in the familiar 18A block. You won't believe it, but as I approached my apartment building, my heart was fluttering like a cook at the sight of a swell girl. It was still quite early, and I didn't meet a single person either on the street or in the lobby, except for those personifying the Triumph of Free Labor on the walls. The first thing that surprised me, brothers, was that all the men and women had been restored. Someone very clever had painted over the obscene sayings pouring from their lips and the superfluous body parts. The second surprise was that the elevator worked! I pressed the button, and it took me up to the tenth floor, purring contentedly and bulging the scrubbed walls. Unfortunately, the surprises didn't end there.

With a sinking heart, I approached door 10-8 and, carefully opening it with my key, tiptoed into the hallway.

Three pairs of eyes stared at me: two wary and frightened—Mom and Dada—and one completely unfamiliar, but extremely brazen. The brazen one belonged to a huge thug in a tank top and suspenders, who had settled into my place as if he owned the place, lustfully sipping his milky tea and crunching on toast. His millstones moved rhythmically, setting his small, flattened ears in rotation. Upon seeing me, the ancestors' jaws dropped in surprise, and this Pithecanthropus took a noisy gulp and said irritably:

— What the hell is this? Who are you, dude? And where did you get a key? Now, quickly get your ass behind the door and knock, like decent people do. Then explain what you're doing here.

My dad and mom continued to sit with their mittens open, and I was dying to go over to them and help them close them. Apparently, they hadn't read the morning papers yet. Finally, my mom whispered fearfully:

— You ran away? What should we do now? The police are about to show up. Why did this happen to me! Oh-oh-oh!

And then she started crying and wailing, as if for a dead person. I started explaining that everything was fine, that I'd been released, and they could call the Pack and make sure. While I was talking, the stranger snorted discontentedly, and I had the feeling he was about to strike me in the face with a huge, hairy fist and knock the wind out of me. I didn't wait for that and asked politely:

"Let me ask you a few questions now, bro. What the hell are you doing here, lounging around like that? And please, tone it down if you don't want to get it in the nose. Come on, spit it out!"

He looked like a hard worker, like my father. Just as rough, uncouth, crushed by hard work and a lack of intelligence. Only fifteen or twenty years younger. After my words, his eyes widened menacingly and he sat there, unable to utter a word. He could only gulp air like a fish washed up on the beach. So my even older horse spoke up:

"This is all so unexpected, son. You could have at least let us know you were coming back. And besides, we were counting on you being released in five or six years, no sooner. No, don't think we're not glad to see you..." He looked away and added dully, "It's great that you're free again..."

"Tell me, who is this scarecrow? Why is he silent? Has he got his tongue stuck up his ass? At least explain clearly what's going on here?"

"That's Joe," Mom said quietly. "He lives here now. A lodger, that's who he is." And she began again: "O-o-o!"

"Listen, you bastard," Joe finally recovered. "I know everything about you. About what you did and what you did, breaking the hearts of those good people, your parents. And now you're back, huh? Back to make their lives hell again? Well, take that," he said, making a big fig and holding it under my nose. "Over my dead body. Because they're like family to me, and I won't let anyone hurt them!"

"Ah, so that's how it is!" I muttered, feeling angry tears of fear, pain, despair, and helplessness welling up in my eyes. "I'll give you five minutes to get out of my room."

And I headed for my lair and opened the door before that bastard could block my way. At the sight of what had become of my room, my balls sank to the carpet, and then, as if on an elastic band, they jumped up somewhere in my throat. This was no longer my room at all, my friends. The joy of my soul—the stereo—was gone without a trace, and in the place of my flags and pennants, there were now brazen boxer's faces, and among them—the smug, smiling pack of the guest.

"Where did you put my things, you lousy goat?" I yelled, turning to Pithecanthropus Joe. But instead, Dad answered again:

"The police confiscated everything, son. In accordance with the new regulation on compensation for victims of armed robbery."

I sat down on the edge of the chair, dumbfounded, and this well-behaved cretin barked, not noticing my state:

— Ask permission before you plop your dirty butt down on clean furniture!

"Don't yell, or your belly button will come undone, you bastard!" I barked back, but, feeling a warning surge of pain, I smiled pitifully and added more quietly:

— After all, this is my home, my rumnata, isn't it, friend? Well, what will be your decision?

Dad said, avoiding meeting me with Aizami:

"We need to think this through, son. We can't just throw Joe out on the street. That would be inhumane. And besides, we have a two-year contract with him, right, Joe?"

He nodded his massive head affirmatively, continuing to stand there with a deliberately indifferent, "it's up to you" look. I could see my father was deeply uncomfortable, but then jealousy flared within me, and I said mercilessly:

— Da-a-a-a know-it-all. So, with Joe, like a human being, but what about your own son? You only care about your own peace of mind, and you couldn't care less about me. Besides, it's extra money, which is never too much. How much does he pay you? I'll pay double...

"From thieves' money? Or will you finish off someone else?" Dad cried out bitterly, and Mother cringed as if struck.

And then, believe it or not, I couldn’t take it anymore and burst into tears out of self-pity.

"I wish I'd stayed in jail. At least I had a roof over my head there. Oh well, God be with you. I've moved, and you'll never see me again. I'll go my own way. Let all this rest on your conscience."

"You shouldn't leave with a heavy heart, son. Bitterness never led anyone down the right path."

\- Well, that's my business, father. Goodbye!

I turned sharply and walked towards the door, catching a glimpse out of the corner of my eye of Joe putting his arm around the shoulders and soothingly stroking the quiet, crying woman—my mother.

  

So, my friends, I was left homeless, without a family. I wandered aimlessly down the street, watched by the curious and wary eyes of passersby. Perhaps some recognized me, but most were puzzled by the strange creature strolling the streets in a light paper suit on such a damn cold winter day. The rest simply didn't care about me, just as I didn't care about them. The only thing I wanted was to think about nothing else.

Automatically, I took a bus downtown, walked back to Taylor Place, and stopped in front of the music store. Everything was the same. Entering the store, I looked around for skinny, bald, and obliging Andy, from whom I'd bought records in the good old days. But he was nowhere to be seen. People were screaming and squealing with delight all around, listening to the latest hysterical hits that resembled a cat fight. Behind the counter stood an unfamiliar guy, not much older than his customers. He was dancing, snapping his fingers, and laughing like crazy. I discreetly pushed aside all this riff-raff and waited until the hitman noticed me.

— I would like to listen to Mozart’s “Fortieth”.

"Forty what?" he didn't understand.

— A symphony, my friend. The Fortieth Symphony in G minor by W. A. Mozart.

\- Go into that booth over there, weirdo, and I'll connect you to something symbolic.

I swallowed the taunt and entered the indicated boutique. I put on my earphones and discovered they weren't "Fortieth," but "Prague." The bastard put on the first Mozart he saw on the shelf. "Screw you!" I thought. "The main thing is not to lose my temper, because it will be very difficult to get back into it later..." But I hadn't taken one thing into account, although I vaguely feared it. With a powerful crescendo of Mozartian chords, a familiar pain built within me, driving me to the brink of frenzy. With a diminuendo, it subsided, only to fill me again a few bars later. Apparently, this was now forever programmed into me by those sadistic films, invariably accompanied by symphonic music. This is the breakdown, my friends. The Medmen have forever deprived me of the greatest joy in this vile life.

Unable to bear the destructive musical resonance, I covered my ears and ran out of the salon in panic, amid the laughter and jeers of the little ones I would have playfully tossed around in the past.

I wandered down the street like a blind man until I saw the Mulberry Bar in front of me. Now I knew what I needed. The glass shop was unusually quiet, and a complete stranger stood behind the counter.

"A big piston of milk plus," I ordered. Man nodded understandingly, fiddled conspiratorially under the counter, and handed me a hefty mug of the white drink. To avoid being seen again, I retreated to one of the curtained cubicles, sat down on a plush armchair, and drank, and drank, and drank, feeling the accumulated filth gradually evaporate.

When I'd finished every last drop of milk, strange things started happening to me. I stared at the silver wrapper from a pack of Znegtumors lying on the floor, and it suddenly began to grow, growing, bathing everything around me in a blinding light. It filled the stall, the Mulberry, the street, the city, the world, the universe. I was floating somewhere in the middle, uttering words I didn't understand:

"Dear carrion! Dear outcasts, perverts, excrement-mongers! I see you, though you are dust..." Then, in the silvery cosmic distance, statues appeared, glowing with unearthly colors. They came closer and closer to me, and suddenly I saw that these were not statues at all, but God himself with his horde of saints and angels. They seemed to be made of white marble. White, flowing beards and enormous white wings behind their backs. These living statues advanced on me, as if they wanted to crush me, and I heard my own thin voice: "Ee-e-e-e!" And then I realized that I had to get rid of everything: clothes, body, thoughts, name... As soon as I did this, I immediately felt unearthly bliss and peace. God and all the saints nodded their heads in approval and began to dissolve, dissolve, dissolve, until they disappeared completely...

Coming to, I stared blankly at the empty glass in front of me and suddenly realized that Death was the only answer to all my problems. Disappear! Evaporate! Vanish! To God, to the devil, or to hell—it's all the same!

Yes, but what's the best way to do it? And then I remembered the black bag with the skull and crossbones. My favorite razor should be in there somewhere. However, imagining myself with my throat slit, lying in a pool of my own scarlet blood, I shuddered with disgust and instantly felt the familiar symptoms. My damned immune system was working even against me! No! I had to do everything quietly, calmly, painlessly—lie down and fall into eternal sleep. The end had to creep up on me... Yes, but what would I swallow? And there was no one to ask. I couldn't just walk up to the first person I met and tell them I was sick of myself and the world and wanted to end it all quickly, quietly and without fuss. Finally, I decided to go to the public library and educate myself on painless suicides.

"I'll just give them a dirty trick," I thought vindictively, walking down Marganita Boulevard and Boothby Avenue, straight to the seedy library. "Let them spend the rest of their lives punishing themselves for ruining a young soul: phaser-mazer with their stinking usurper Joe, and Dr. Brodsky, and Dr. Branham with his minister, and all the rest, including the boastful government..."

Despite all its boasting, the government didn't exactly subsidize our library, that hub of human wisdom where billions of useless words gathered dust on the shelves. It hadn't been renovated in a hundred years, not since I, a six-year-old, visited it with my mom and dad for the first and last time. This lousy, run-down establishment was divided into two sections. One lent out books, the other a reading room with plenty of newspapers, magazines (and not a single one with naked women!). So, I went to this second section, where several old men and women sat, reeking of poverty and impending death. Some of them stood by the newspaper stands, reading the latest news with teary, half-blind eyes, intending to pass it on directly to their relatives in the afterlife. Others slowly leafed through journals, others read something in them or pretended to read, dozing in the warmth and senile atmosphere. Two even snored loudly, humming trills through their noses, but no one paid any attention to these nightingales. Observing the sclerotic fragments of a former life, I completely forgot how the hell I'd ended up in this pantheon. Straining myself and mentally replaying what had happened to me in "Mullein," I remembered that I'd wanted to find here the most painless way to settle scores with a hateful life. I approached the shelf with reference literature. In the mournful row stood thick reference books, instructions, recommendations, useful advice for all occasions, and not a single one for death. I picked up a medical book at random, leafed through it, and nearly threw up, as it was filled with drawings and photographs of terrible wounds and illnesses. I quickly put it back and pulled a familiar book from the shelf, beautifully bound with gold embossing. Yes! It was the Bible. Maybe in it at least I'll find words of comfort. Once, in the Pack, it helped me. How long ago that was! I sat down at the table next to some decrepit old man and opened the Holy Scriptures. But all I found were punishments of seventy, seven lashes, and the same number of forgiveness. Some Jews were fighting and cursing each other and everything under the sun. Such pictures of biblical life gave me stomach cramps. So strong, I almost wanted to cry! Trying to hold back my groans, I gritted my teeth, and the old man, standing with both feet in the grave, asked, looking at me with curiosity from under his cracked glasses:

— What's the matter, boy? Are you feeling unwell?

"It's so bad I want to die," I admitted honestly. "What's the best way to do that? You should know everything about death."

"Shhh!" hissed another rotten stump, not taking his eyes off some magazine with absurd geometric figures.

The first old man said philosophically:

"You have to be mature enough to die, too. You're still too young, boy. You have your whole life ahead of you. Suffer some, and then think about it."

— In front! That's for sure, it's in front of me, like a pair of fake breasts.

The Geometrist hissed at us again, and several more walking corpses joined him. Then he glanced at me, and we immediately recognized each other. Indignantly throwing down the magazine, he yelled at the entire room:

"So it's you, you bastard! I have an excellent memory for faces! I finally caught you, you freak!"

"'Crystallography'—that's what he was carrying from the library that time," I recalled. Clothes cut to shreds. Pages of mangled books fluttering in the air. What a bummer! And I had to run into him. I had to run away! But the old man quickly jumped to his feet and sank his claw into my shoulder, screaming like a madman:

"Now he's in our hands, colleagues! This is the young bastard who irrevocably destroyed the rarest books on crystallography! The time for payback has come, you cowardly, heartless jackal. Now we'll make fun of you..."

He pressed his skinny, bony finger against my chest and spoke angrily, like the chairman of the Holy Inquisition before the burning of a heretic:

"That vile bastard and his buddies beat me half to death. I only woke up in the hospital, missing teeth, missing clothes, missing an umbrella, but covered in bruises and scrapes, and with a broken rib..."

"But that was two years ago!" I shouted in fear at the old men and women approaching me. "I've already been punished, learned a lesson for life. Look, here are my photos in the newspapers. They say everything about me."

"Punishment, you say?" one of the old men, who looked like a former soldier, said with a grin. "There are no punishments for the likes of you. You must be exterminated like rabid dogs!"

"Well, fine, fine! In our free country, everyone can have their own opinion. However, the government has a different point of view. Excuse me, but I have to go."

I slowly made my way to the exit, thinking that my problem could be solved with aspirin, just any aspirin from any pharmacy. Swallow a hundred pills—and you're screwed!

Noticing my retreat, the crystallographer shouted maliciously:

"Don't let him get away! We'll explain everything about crime and punishment to him now. Grab him, friends!"

From all sides came the cry:

— Kill him! Tear him to pieces! Drive the scoundrel's teeth into his throat! Crucify him! Crucify him! Crucify him!

It was a furious attack of Old Age on Youth, the eternal struggle of the old with the new.

The screaming horde surrounded me from all sides, cutting off my escape. They pushed, pinched, bit, scratched, pulled my hair, tried to poke me in the eye with their gnarled fingers. I only feebly pushed away the most persistent ones and prayed to God that I wouldn't hurt them, mindful of the pain lurking around the corner, keenly watching what would happen.

Finally, a young librarian appeared in response to the noise and said sternly:

"What the hell is going on here? Stop it immediately! This isn't a gladiator arena, it's a reading room."

Nobody paid any attention to him, and then he said angrily:

\- Oh, really! In that case, I'll call the police.

And then I did something I would never have done under other circumstances. I cried out with tears in my voice:

— Yes, yes! Please do it. Protect me from these lunatics.

Then someone bloodied my nose. Wiping away the bloody snot, I threw caution to the wind and swung my hefty shoulder. About six old men dropped at once, groaning and moaning. But three bulldogs held on tight, and I dragged them into the lobby. Someone else grabbed my thigh. Others arrived. I fell, and they started kicking me with their legs, prostheses, and crutches... At that moment, young, laughing voices rang out in the foyer:

\- Stop this mess, boys! Look how mischievous you've become!

It was the police who arrived.

  

For a moment, everything before my eyes swam and wavered, like in that dream about God and the statues, and there was a hum in my head. When the haze cleared a bit, it seemed I'd seen those coppolas somewhere before. The one who'd been shouting at the enraged old men, "Enough, enough, enough!" while trying to steel himself, I'd never seen before. But the other two I'd definitely seen before. They were laughing as they dispersed the crowd, good-naturedly lashing the old men's backs with small whips, muttering:

"Cut it out, you naughty kids. We'll show you how to rebel and disturb the peace, you old bastards."

With jokes and banter they drove the half-dead avengers back into Readinghall and turned to me, who was rising from the floor in embarrassment.

— Who do I see! Is that you, little Alex? Long time no see, my friend. How are you? I see you're doing poorly.

I stared in amazement at the uniformed brute, whose face was difficult to discern behind his helmet with the visor down. His voice, however, was very familiar. I glanced at the second man and flinched in surprise. That insane face was unmistakable.

\- Gee-gee-gee! - Cyrus cackled, and it was he.

Taking a closer look at the second one, I recognized the fat Billy. The two sworn enemies had become best friends—inseparable, and even more so—guardians of the law.

"Wow!" I whistled. "Keer? Billy?"

"What, surprised?" the ex-Debila approached me, grinning from ear to ear. "Life is full of surprises."

— This can't be! This shouldn't be! Is this some kind of masquerade again?

"Your Aizas aren't lying to you. We aren't either. Everything is fair and legal. A great job for a real man. I recommend it."

"But you're too young. Or what, do they now recruit people based on body weight and a high IQ like yours?"

Cyrus didn't catch the mockery and responded quite reasonably:

"You're right, Alik. The police need tough guys like Billy and me to break the backs of jerks like you. And as for age, you're wrong about that. I'm already eighteen. You were the greenest of our bunch..."

— And yet I refuse to believe it. You—and suddenly the Coppolas!..

"You'll soon believe it," Billy-boy promised sullenly, turning to the third cop who was holding my shoulder. "I think, Rex, it would be better if we deal with him in a family way, without the usual police routine. We're old friends, after all. Looks like that hooligan's back at it again, despite all the nonsense those scribblers wrote about his reformation. We know him better than anyone. The son of a bitch, he's bullying poor old people again. Well then! Let's show him we're not wasting our time."

"What's he stinking about, Kir?" I turned to Debila. "They attacked me, not the other way around. Your job is to protect me from them, not them from me... You must remember, Kir, that tichera we took out two years ago here, not far from the library. Well, he showed up here, identified me, and set that whole crazy pack on me."

"What are you saying?" Kir chuckled. "I don't recall anything like that. And stop calling me 'Kir.' Just call me 'officer.'"

"Well, enough childhood memories," Billy interjected. He wasn't as fat as he used to be. "We can't just walk past these thugs with razors in their pockets." The bastard hasn't forgotten how I 'shaved' him a couple of years ago. "It's our duty to protect the free citizens of a free country from them!"

They twisted my hands just in case, pulled a razor out of my pocket and, leading me out of the library, pushed me into a waiting patrol car, the driver of which turned out to be Rex, whom I didn’t know.

I couldn't shake the wild thought that my ex-friends were joking and that Kir was about to rip off his visor and burp, "Hee-hee-hee! Welcome back, Alex-boy!" But I was wrong. It was all real.

Trying to hide my growing fear, I asked:

"What about old Pete? They told me about Josh..."

"Pete? Oh, that one... We met him recently," Kir replied with a meaningful grin.

Noticing that we were leaving the town, I asked with concern:

— Where are you taking me?

"It's still too light," Billy replied, without turning his head. "A little walk through the winter country. It's so beautiful and... deserted. We can't exactly balance the bill in front of everyone..."

"What balance?" I asked, genuinely alarmed. "The old one is long gone. I've already gotten my due. I've been cured,

"We've read about it, we've heard about it," Kir said indifferently. "We even had a political briefing on the matter. The superintendent spent a whole hour talking about how great and effective it is. Now we'll put it to the test."

"Oh, you read to me? You've never even picked up a newspaper, let alone a book?" I couldn't resist making a sarcastic remark.

He turned and hit me hard in the nose before I could dodge. My vision went dark, and scarlet blood began to drip from the broken nose.

"Well, the force is on your side now, you stinking bastard," I said bitterly, wiping my face. "But it won't always be like this..."

“Here we are,” Billy said happily.

I was pushed out of the car. There wasn't a soul nearby. Silent, sullen trees surrounded the four of us, their bare branches hanging limply.

The driver remained behind the wheel, idly smoking and flipping through a comic book. It was quickly getting dark, so he turned on the headlights so his colleagues could better see where to hit your humble, helpless narrator.

I won't go into detail about what they did to me. I'll just say they gave me a good beating. With clubs, fists, and feet. And the whole time they were "teaching" me, I was afraid to even think about fighting back. If it hadn't been for that damned Ludovico, I would have had more trouble with them...

Finally they got tired, and one of them, I don’t remember who, said in a businesslike manner:

\- Well, that's enough for now. Let's go!

Having given me a farewell kick in the face, they climbed into the car and drove away, leaving me lying on the grass dusted with bloody snow.

I don't know how long I lay there, balancing on the edge of consciousness and unconsciousness. A fine, icy rain and snow brought me back to my senses. I got up on all fours, crawled on all fours to the nearest tree, and rose with a groan, hugging it like someone else's wife. There was no sound, no light around. Where was I supposed to go, a homeless, beaten tramp without a cent in my pocket? I howled like a wolf, scaring away the creatures lurking in the bushes.

  

Home! Home! Home! – my whole being yearned for it. A place where I could lay my head and find some rest, if only for a while. And home I have come, brothers! Wandering like a blind man through an icy desert of human hatred and indifference, I came to an oasis with a funny sign above the entrance: "OUR HOME." It seems I've been here before, in that other life...

As I approached the cottage gate, I touched the bleeding, loose teeth with the tip of my tongue, feeling the emptiness where two of them had been.

Oh, God bless them! It's even for the best—there's hope the writer, if he's still here, won't recognize me. Now I wore a completely different mask, revealing my entire essence...

Slipping on the rain-swollen clay path, I hobbled to the door and carefully scratched. Beyond the door was deathly silence. Were the gates before me: heaven or hell? I knocked more insistently and heard footsteps approaching. The door swung open, and a strong male voice rang out, peering into the darkness:

\- Yes, who's here?

"Oh! For God's sake, help me, good man!" I pleaded, real tears in my voice. "The police beat me for no reason and left me to die by the roadside. For God's sake, let me sit by the fire and give me something hot to drink..."

"Come in, whoever you are!" the writer stepped aside, shining his flashlight on me. "Come in and tell me of your misfortunes, poor man..."

I took a step forward. My legs gave way, and I fell right onto the cottage's owner, who was looking at me with genuine concern and compassion.

I woke up in a chair by the fireplace. A compassionate writer with sad, all-seeing eyes was handing me a tall tumbler of neat whiskey. I took it with a trembling hand and drank it down in one gulp, diluting it with the saliva and blood that had accumulated in my mouth.

"What kind of monsters beat you up like that, boy?" the writer asked sympathetically, peering into my swollen, battered face.

"Our valiant guardians of order," I tried to smile. "Some bastards in police uniforms."

"Another, far from the last, victim of our troubled times," he stated mournfully. "I'll go draw you a bath."

Focusing hard, I looked around. Save for the fireplace and two armchairs, the rest of the space was filled with books. The artistic disarray that reigned everywhere testified to the absence of a woman's hand. A familiar typewriter sat on a low table, next to which sheets of paper were neatly stacked. "A CLOCKWORK ORANGE"—that's what lay here that night. For some reason, this title had firmly lodged itself in my memory, and nothing could dislodge it—not Brodsky with his Ludovico, not the brainwashing my friends-enemies inflicted on me... Now the main thing is not to give myself away. Otherwise, despite all his kindness, this writer will add to my wrath and leave me to croak on the street. And you, Alexander the Little, will turn into a piece of dog shit on the road... And right now, you so desperately need help and compassion! And you were driven to all this by those who, against your will, forced you to wander like the Wandering Jew in search of goodness and warmth and the people to whom you could give them. But will they be willing to accept your gift as atonement for your sins?

"Well, now I'll redeem you," the writer said tenderly. "I'll wash away all your sins and lift the burden from your soul." He looked searchingly into my eyes, and his gaze made me feel uneasy. "But first, I need to stop the bleeding. I'll cauterize your abrasions with boric acid. Just be patient, my dear."

He carefully cleaned my wounds with a swab soaked in boric acid. Seeing the tears of gratitude in my eyes, he sheepishly patted my shoulder: "Well, that's enough, that's enough..."

Then I took a hot bath, which made a man out of me. ORANGE's father gave me pajamas warmed by the fireplace and warm fur slippers, and I was finally convinced that now I would survive. Reiter left again, and after a while his cheerful voice came from the kitchen, inviting me to either a late dinner or an early breakfast.

I went down to the kitchen, where the table was already set with gleaming forks, knives, and even snow-white napkins. A tall loaf of fluffy white brad lay in the center, along with a pot-bellied bottle of Prima Soy. Nearby, a delicious scrambled egg with ham sizzled, and a steaming cup of milk tea. I hadn't realized how hungry I was.

I quickly finished the scrambled eggs and ate several plump sausages, covering it all with a huge slice of bread spread with butter and jam. Sipping strong, thick tea, I noted gratefully:

— I haven't eaten such delicious food in a long time. I don't know how to thank you.

“I think I know who you are,” the writer smiled. “If you’re who I think you are, then you’ve come to the right place. Were those your photos in the morning papers? Are you a poor victim of this new, inhumane method? If so, then Providence itself sent you to me. Poor guy. First, you were tormented in prison, and then you became the target of our merciless police. They’ve recruited some of the most vile scoundrels now. I sympathize with you sincerely.”

I wanted to confirm his words, but I was too filled with self-pity. I just blinked and listened to what he was saying.

"You're not the first to turn to me for help. Our village has become a favorite haunt of the police, where they mete out unjust judgments and reprisals, calling it brainwashing... Fate itself has brought you to me—a victim of the authorities' double tyranny! Perhaps you've heard of me?"

I instantly became wary and answered, choosing my words carefully:

— I'm familiar with the title "A CLOCKWORK ORANGE." I haven't read it, but I've heard it's amazing.

"Really? You heard about my novel?" the writer beamed. "Tell me a little about yourself."

"There's not much to tell," I said, embarrassed. "Once upon a time, there lived a stupid, arrogant brat who thought too much of himself. One day, his so-called friends talked him into breaking into the house of an old, lonely woman. I had no intention of harming her, believe me. Just an innocent, childish prank. I decided to show off in front of my friends. This old bird spotted me and had a heart attack. Long story short, she kicked the bucket, and I ended up in jail..."

\- Ok, I see. Please continue.

— Already there, in prison, I caught the eye of the Minister of Correctional Institutions, who visited our birdhouse, and he decided to try out Ludovico’s method on me...

"Okay, okay," the writer leaned toward me. "Tell me more about this."

He was so intrigued by this that he didn't even notice his elbow had gotten stuck in a jam-filled socket. His eyes gleamed feverishly, his mouth dropped open…

Trying to somehow thank him for the kindness he had shown me, I told the writer in detail about what they had done to me at Dr. Brodsky’s clinic.

He was so captivated by my story that he didn't interrupt me once. He just nodded his head—understandingly, indignantly, disapprovingly... When I finished, he sighed heavily and began clearing the plates.

“Let me wash them myself,” I offered.

"Rest, rest, poor thing," he said, turning on the hot water. "You've undoubtedly sinned and broken laws, but what they've devised for you as punishment goes beyond all bounds. They've turned you into some kind of machine, a semiautomated machine, deprived of free choice. You've been programmed not even for goodness as such, but to perform acts approved by society, actions that please it... I can clearly imagine your behavior in extreme situations, under emotional stress. Now everything—music and physical love, literature and art—has turned from sources of pleasure into sources of pain and suffering for you. Poor, poor Alex."

“You have determined everything accurately, sir,” I agreed, lighting an elegant, long, evil-looking cigarette with a gold mouthpiece.

"They always go too far," the writer said thoughtfully, washing the same plate for the third time. "And in your case, they clearly overdid it. A person deprived of choice ceases to be human. They crossed the line where a crime against humanity begins."

"Your reasoning is very similar to that of our prison chaplain. He, too, claimed that without moral choice, there is no human being. True, he constantly referred to God, who oversees the correctness of such choices."

"Really? He thinks so too?" the writer perked up. "Well, it couldn't be otherwise. It's the foundation of Christian teaching. Oh well. I see I've tired you out. We'll talk tomorrow, when my friends gather. I think you'll be very useful to us. With your help, we can expose our vile government, which is once again striving for absolute power. We'll show the people the complete inhumanity of their program, aimed at turning our youth into mechanical executors of their will. And they're even proud of it, presenting Ludovico's inhumane technique as a panacea for all social ills."

He continued to wipe the same plate.

“Sir, this is the fifth time you’ve rubbed the same plate,” I couldn’t help but say.

"Really?" he said, coming to and staring at the plate, polished to a shine. "I'm too distracted for household chores. My wife usually took care of them, but I was completely absorbed in writing."

"Your wife, sir?" I asked with feigned indifference. "Did she leave you?"

“Yes, she did…” he repeated with overwhelming anguish and pain. “She died. You see, she was brutally beaten and raped by four young scumbags. Right in this house, before my eyes. And I couldn’t protect her…” His voice wavered, and his face twisted in grief and suffering. “The poor thing couldn’t survive the shock… And as you can see, I’m alive.”

He quickly turned away so I wouldn't see his tears. But I saw something else. A quiet winter night. Four masked men tricking their way into a peaceful, cozy home and committing a brutal massacre on innocent people. And I was their leader...

As expected, the image that appeared before my eyes triggered a severe attack of Ludovico's disease. My face turned pale and became covered in sweat. The delicious food rose in my throat, ready to burst out at any moment. Noticing this, the writer interpreted my condition in his own way:

"You see what I've driven you to with my talk. Come, I'll show you your bedroom. This used to be my Helen's room. Poor, poor boy. What have those monsters driven you to! Another victim of the modern world, like her, my unfortunate girl..."

  

I fell asleep only after he gave me some powerful sedative, the kind he often used himself. I passed out instantly and slept dreamlessly for about ten hours. When I awoke, it was a late, frosty, sunny morning. Birds were singing loudly outside the cottage window. With some effort, I remembered where I was. For the first time in days, I felt calm and relatively safe. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the kitchen. I decided to luxuriate until they called me for breakfast. My thoughts flowed smoothly and serenely, and I was close to saying, "Stop, moment, you are beautiful!" Suddenly, I wanted to know the name of my savior and benefactor. I crawled out from under the blanket and padded barefoot to the large bookcase that covered the entire wall. Somewhere around here, there was bound to be a copy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and it would certainly bear the name of the author—the kind owner of OUR HOUSE. However, to my disappointment, the shelves were filled with clever books… and not a single copy of ORANGE. I cautiously crept into the adjacent room, the writer's bedroom. Upon entering, I stopped dead in my tracks, because that same girl was glaring reproachfully at me from the wall. Suppressing the pain of association, I hurried over to the hanging shelf with its beech-colored pages and found a thin book. On the spine, after the familiar title, was written in gold: "F. Alexander." Good God! His name was Alex too! I leafed through the little book, but still couldn't figure out what it was about. I was struck by the insane manner in which it was written, with numerous "ahs" and "ohs." The only thing I took away from this cursory viewing was that in our time, everyone—him, me, my ancestors with their faithful lodger, Cyrus, Billy, the late Josh, and you, yes, you, my patient listeners—are being turned into mechanical robots or their spare parts. While every person is a unique individual, a unique fruit of Mother Nature. My F. Alexander naively believed that all these human fruits grow on one universal tree in a cosmic garden planted by the Lord God. And this gardener needs us all so that he can pour out his grace on us and, in turn, rejoice in our good deeds... The same idealistic nonsense and ah-oh-oh-oh chatter followed. And I thought: maybe this namesake of mine really did go crazy after his wife's death? But then his quite healthy voice, warm and friendly, was heard from below, and I hurried to have breakfast.

"Well, did you get enough sleep?" he asked with a smile. "It's already ten. I didn't wake you on purpose. I've already managed to work for several hours."

"That's very kind of you," I replied politely, spreading butter on my toast. "Are you writing a new book?"

— No, some articles. Then I talked to friends on the phone.

"Do you even have a phone?" I blurted out, forgetting all about caution.

"Why do you think I don't have it?" he answered a question with a question and looked at me intently.

"Oh, nothing," I looked away, silently cursing my carelessness. "I just didn't notice him yesterday."

"That's not surprising. You were in such a state," he softened, and I thought that he must remember every last detail of that terrible night.

"Be careful, boy, if you don't want to be drawn and quartered... with all the love in the world," I said to myself.

We chewed in silence for a while. Then he said:

"I've been calling people all morning who absolutely must be interested in your case. You have no idea what a powerful weapon you are in our fight to prevent this anti-people government from winning the upcoming elections again. With your help, we'll knock their main trump card out of their hands—their vaunted achievements in the fight against crime. Surely you'll help us expose their fascist methods of modifying individual consciousness? They could start with criminals and end with us, democrats, all dissenters. Can you imagine what could happen then? All these experiments for the good of the people could turn into complete totalitarianism!"

“Frankly speaking, I’m not entirely clear on how I can help you with this,” I admitted honestly.

A mad glint appeared in the writer's eyes, and he began to speak like a madman, becoming increasingly heated and swallowing his words:

"You are a living witness to these diabolical plans. The people, the common people, must know, must see what is being hatched behind their backs."

He jumped up from the table and began pacing the kitchen as if rehearsing an angry, accusatory speech:

"Are you really going to allow the same thing to happen to your sons as to this poor victim of the government's arbitrary rule? Do you really want the government to decide from now on who is declared a criminal, an enemy of the nation, and who is not?"

Coming to his senses, he sat down at the table again, but still didn’t touch the egg.

"While you were sleeping, I wrote an article. In a day or two, it will appear in the newspapers, along with your photo. You just need to sign this mournful list of crimes and injustices committed against you with the blessing of our government."

"Well, what good does it do you, sir?" I asked, genuinely curious. "I mean, what will you gain personally, other than a decent fee for your article? Why are you so vehemently opposed to the current government? Would another one be much better?"

The writer grabbed the edge of the table so hard his knuckles turned white and said with pathos, grinding his smoke-stained teeth:

Someone has to fight for the ideals of goodness and justice, right? I'm a quiet, peaceful person by nature. But I can't stand by and watch what's sacred to me be trampled upon. Honest people must fight against any form of violence against the individual. Such are the traditions of freedom. But the masses are too inert. They don't care about anything but their own well-being and personal peace. In their sated torpor, the people might even allow the rise of fascism. That's why they must be constantly stirred, stirred, stirred!

And then, my friends, he pulled a trick that made me cower in fear. His eyes blazing, he snatched a fork from the table and, in a rage, stabbed it repeatedly into the wall. Having mangled the utensils, he angrily threw them on the floor.

Then, as if nothing had happened, he turned to your poor storyteller and said with a gentle smile:

— Eat, boy, eat. Poor victim of the modern world. You can have my egg too.

He clearly wasn't all there.

"It's very noble, everything you say, sir. But what will I get out of it? Will it cure me? Will I be able to listen to the Choral Symphony without feeling like a pregnant bitch? Will I be able to live a normal life again? What will become of me in the end?"

Here, brothers, he looked at me as if I had nothing to do with it and my fate meant nothing compared to Freedom, Equality, Fraternity, Democracy, and all that abstract nonsense. From his surprised and slightly irritated expression, I realized that his grandiose plans had no place for me personally. He looked at me as if I were a hopeless egotist and said vaguely:

\- Well, as I already said, you will be a living witness, a pu-erh boy, contributing to the triumph of high ideals... Come on, finish your breakfast... I will show you my article, which will go to the Weekly Trumpit under your name, unfortunate victim.

What I later read in his office, my friends, was a long, vague, sentimental rant designed to bring a tear to the eye of our fat-bellied philistines. Reading it, I nearly shed a tear myself—so sorry was I for the poor boy (me) as he recounted his suffering and how an immoral government had robbed him of the will and ability to resist violence and injustice. I then went on, sounding like a professor, to describe how the same fate awaits all people if they don't put an end to the current administration's anti-people acts.

"Great!" I praised. "It touches your soul and turns all your guts upside down."

"What?" he asked suspiciously, narrowing his eyes.

— Oh, that? That means it goes straight to the heart. Nadsad language. That's what all the teenagers talk about these days, sir.

Writer went into the kitchen to wash the dishes, thinking hard about something, as if trying to remember something very important... I, however, thought nothing of anything, surrendering myself to chance. It was easier that way. Life is generally easier for fools. Their demands are minimal, as is the expectation of them. Sit and snore. Or like a baby: shit yourself and keep quiet, waiting for someone to change your clothes...

My profound thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of the front doorbell. A writer rushed out of the kitchen, wiping his wet hands on the frontiersman.

"Here are my friends!" he announced joyfully. From the antichambre came the usual "hello-hello," "ha-ha-ha and ho-ho-ho," "fine weather," and "nice to see you, old man!" Then three weirdos tumbled into the living room and stared inquisitively at me, and one of them, looking like he had been suffering from malnutrition or tuberculosis, smiled warmly and said in a low, smoky bass:

"So that's what he's like, your uncouth namesake. Never mind, we'll straighten him out in no time." He laughed good-naturedly.

F. Alex introduced his buddies. The deep-voiced, dystrophic man, covered from head to toe in the ash of a huge cigar he never removed from his hairy mouth, was named Z. Dolin. Then there was another man named Rubinstein—a short, plump fellow with round metal glasses, an academic beard, and a cap. The third was D.B. DaSilva. This one wasn't a fellow at all, but a spermatozoon, just as fast, energetic, and assertive. He reeked of expensive perfume. All three of them squeezed my hand for a long time, enthusiastically slapping the shoulder and peering into my eyes, demonstrating the best of intentions. Finally, Z. Dolin boomed:

"A magnificent specimen. Just what we need. We can even make him up for the photos to make him look even more sickly and beaten down... We'll turn him into a real zombie."

I was categorically against being "beaten down" and made to look tame. So I protested vehemently:

— What is that for? What is your friend, Mr. Alexander, talking about?

Instead of answering, the writer said with a puzzled expression:

"It's strange, but I can't shake the feeling that I've met him somewhere before. Such a peculiar manner of speaking..."

He frowned, trying to remember something, and my insides went cold. But then DaSilva intervened:

"The main thing is to organize public appearances. We'll show it to the public... live. And, of course, widespread publicity. The main leitmotif: wasted young lives. Let's stir up the anthill! Let's set people's hearts on fire!"

His dark face lit up with a thirty-two-toothed smiley face. He was clearly an immigrant.

"But what good will I get out of all this?" the "living witness," whom everyone seemed to have forgotten, couldn't resist asking. "I was tortured in prison, tormented in the clinic, thrown out of the house by my own parents and their righteous lodger, beaten up by crazy old men, and almost sent to the next world by my newfound Coppola friends. What will happen to me?"

Rubinstein placed his hand on my shoulder with a reassuring gesture:

"You'll see, lad, the Party won't neglect you in its gratitude. A very pleasant and very significant surprise awaits you at the end of this campaign. So don't worry. We won't abandon you to the mercy of fate, which has already been very unfair to you. The triumph of justice and the general well-being—those are our ultimate goals!"

"To hell with surprises!" I fumed. "This damned life has already thrown me enough of them! The only thing I want is to become normal and healthy, like before. To be able to decide for myself what to do, to choose my own friends, and not be an obedient puppet in the hands of fellow travelers to the other world. Is anyone in your stinking party capable of returning me to normal life?!"

“Cough-cough-cough,” Z. Dolin coughed meaningfully.

"You are destined to become a martyr for a just cause," he said with pathos. "But we will not abandon you, Alexander!"

This prospect didn’t sit well with me, and I screamed at the top of my lungs:

"I'm not a condom—I used it and threw it away. And I'm not the idiot you're trying to make me out to be, you dirty schemers! I'm not some kind of moron..."

"Moron, moron..." F. Alexander repeated thoughtfully. "It sounds like a nickname. I've heard it somewhere before... Strange... very strange..."

— What's so strange about that? Gogol-Mogol, Vanka-Vstanka, Kirill-the-Moron.

Oh my God!

I looked at the writer in fear. The expression on his face sent shivers down my spine. "Looks like he let it slip!" Keeping a wary eye on the writer, I edged toward the door, intending to slip into my room upstairs, where my clothes were. I had to run before he figured me out.

"Damn! It looks so much like him," F. Alexander snarled. "But that can't be! God, if it were him, I'd tear him apart right there. But that's impossible..."

"Come on, calm down, old man," DaSilva patted him on the shoulder. "It's all in the past. Those were different scoundrels. We have to help this poor guy, who's very useful to our cause."

"I'll go change... There's my dress, or rather, I mean clothing," I said quickly from the stairs. "Perhaps it's best for us to part ways. I'm grateful to you for everything, gentlemen, of course, but I have to live my own life..."

At this point everyone became alarmed, and Z. Dolin firmly said:

\- No way, boy. You're in our hands, and we're not going to let you go, you're coming with us. Don't worry, everything will be okay.

Then he quickly jumped up to me and grabbed my hand tightly. A wild thought flashed through my mind to break free and hurt, hurt, hurt these "well-wishers," the sooner the better. But the mere thought of resistance and the inevitable fight made my stomach churn and my head ache. I decided: come what may, and obediently said, avoiding looking at the crazy F. Alexander:

\- Fine! Tell me what I need to do and let's get this over with, brothers.

"That's a clever girl," Rubinstein praised me. "Get dressed, and let's get started."

"Moron, moron, moron," Alexander repeated in a stupor. "Where did I hear that nickname before? Who is he?"

I quickly ran up the stairs, changed my clothes for some cheap second-hand clothes and headed to the car with my three new friends, not daring to say goodbye to the hospitable host of “OUR HOUSE”.

D. B. DaSilva sat behind the wheel, and I settled into the back seat with Rubinstein and Z. Dolin on either side.

After some time, the car entered the town, and five minutes later it stopped in the same area where my native block 18A was located.

"Get out, Alex-boy," said Z. Dolin, still holding the inseparable antagonist in his mouth. "You'll stay here for now."

We entered a standard entrance hall of a standard high-rise building with standardized optimistic paintings on the walls. We went up to who knows which floor, entered a standard flat, and D.B. DaSilva said:

"This is where you'll be staying. Make yourself comfortable, boy. There's food in the fridge, your pajamas in the closet."

"I'd like to clarify one small detail, Alex-boy," Z. Dolin coughed. "Our friend F. Alexander has some strange associations with you. Are you by any chance?.. Anyway, it wasn't you and your friends... at his house then?.. Anyway, do you understand what I want to ask you?"

“I paid for everything in full,” I didn’t lie. “God is my witness. We’re colleagues now. After all, I’m your living witness, right?” I teased them. “So, I paid not only for myself, but also for those traitors who called themselves my friends.” The unpleasant memories gave me colic again. “I think I’ll lie down. I don’t feel well.”

"Lie down, lie down," D.B. DaSilva encouraged me. "This apartment is entirely yours."

They turned and went about their business, locking me in so that, God forbid, I wouldn't slip away and ruin their political plans. I collapsed on the bed, still wearing my boots, my hands tucked behind my head, and stared at the low, fly-smeared, soot-blackened ceiling. How could I live on? Where could I hide from all these well-wishers? Images from my joyless life flitted through my closed eyelids, the faces of hundreds of people I'd met along the way, none of whom I could trust. Without realizing it, I dozed off.

I was woken up by loud music coming from behind the wall.

It was the familiar Symphony No. 3 by the Danish composer Otto Skadelig—a frenetic work, rich in seventh chords, especially in the first movement. It was being performed right now. For a few seconds, I listened with delight to the soul-stirring sounds, but unfortunately, the pleasure was quickly replaced by a tsunami of unbearable pain. Someone strange, invisible, was tying my intestines into knots. I slid off the bed and began rolling on the floor, screaming like a mortally wounded animal. Rolling up to the music-spewing wall, I began scratching it with my nails and gnawing at it with my teeth, screaming hysterically:

— Stop it! Stop the music for heaven's sake!

But it didn't stop and seemed to grow even louder. I pounded the wall with my fists, my feet, my head, but all to no avail. Trying to escape, to hide from this musical torture, I ran into the small hallway and yanked open the door, forgetting it was locked from the outside. I sat down in the middle of the room and shoved my fingers deep into my ears, unaware that I was piercing my eardrums. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to escape from this damned music. Or was I the one cursed?

\- God, help me, if you exist! Save me, Lord!

But the old fool abandoned his lost child.

And then I remembered the only way out He had suggested. He had merely delayed the inevitable outcome, sending me, no, not grace or oblivion, which I apparently didn't deserve, but a pack of crazy old men, crazed Coppolas, and deranged intellectuals.

Leave, disappear from this cruel world!

Grasping the edge of the table, I rose to my feet, step by step, when my attention was caught by the word "DEATH" written large on a brochure. Although I only read "DEATH TO THE GOVERNMENT," I realized it was a sign from above. Gritting my teeth, I picked up another book from the table, its cover depicting an open window. Opening it, I read: "Open your souls, like windows, to the fresh air of freedom, new ideas, and a way of life!"

In the blink of an eye, I jumped onto the windowsill and yanked it open. And I shouted to the world: "Farewell and forgive me! And may God punish you for the life you've wasted!"

To the bravura sounds of music, I dived down into the saving void...

  

So, my brothers and friends, I jumped, determined to end all my suffering at once. But it wasn't the end, though I smashed myself hard on the grass. Luckily, I didn't hit the sidewalk. And the height wasn't high enough to kill me. Plus, my feline instinct kicked in, and I landed on all fours before slamming face-first into the frost-crusted ground. Regardless, I dislocated my joints, severely damaged my spine, and tore my face so that one ear was on the back of my head and my nose was sticking out of the other (or so it seemed to me at the time), before I passed out under the surprised and frightened gazes of passersby.

But I wasn't laughing at all then. Coming to after a million years of unconsciousness, I tried to comprehend what had happened to me and guess which world I was in—the next or this one. If I was in the next, then why did it stink of medicine, alcohol, and antiseptics? If I was in this one, then where was that heavenly scent of fresh flowers coming from? And why couldn't I feel my body at all? I pryed open one eye (the other was tightly bandaged) and looked around. I was swaddled like a baby. An arm and a leg were hanging from traction bars, as if someone had intended to weigh me piece by piece and started with the extremities. A bottle of blood hung on a bracket to the right, and it flowed through a transparent tube straight to the needle stuck in my other arm. But why couldn't I feel any pain? My thoughts became clearer, and I recalled the events that preceded my free fall. A terrible suspicion crept into my soul: the music that had unsettled me was a diabolical invention of my new intellectual friends. They had decided to dramatize the situation to the extreme for their own far-reaching political ends. Are all people really monsters and sadists? In that case, I'm a calf compared to them...

Next to my bed sat a young, bespectacled woman in a white robe. She was engrossed in a novel, and from her ragged breathing and the way she greedily licked her plump lips with the bright red tip of her tongue, I realized she'd reached the scene about this. She was actually quite attractive, and her robe revealed some very tempting breasts. Finally believing I was still alive, I said:

\- Dive in here, baby. We can do it just as well as they can, girl.

However, for some reason I came up with "not fuzhe fem oni, fefochka," since my mouth felt cottony, my tongue wooden, and several more teeth were missing from my swollen gums. Gerla jumped in surprise, dropping her book on the floor, and said, half-joyful, half-disappointed:

\- Oh, you've finally come to your senses.

She hurried out, apparently to inform the doctor. From the absolute silence, I realized I was lying in a private, cozy room with flowers on the nightstand, and not in a disgusting general ward, as had happened to me as a child when I had diphtheria. Back then, I was surrounded by a dozen old, coughing, stinking men, the very sight of whom made me want to either die on the spot or be discharged as soon as possible, just to avoid having to see their vile mugs... With these gloomy thoughts, I again fell into a sleep that resembled death. But then the sexually obsessed nurse appeared again, accompanied by several other men in white coats. The oldest of them leaned over me, lifted the eyelid of his only free eye, felt the pulse on my unbandaged hand, and grunted, sullenly and worriedly: "Hm-hm-hm, it could have been worse... He got off easy." Opening one eye, I noticed among the white coats the compassionate face of a chaplain from the old Pack, who said with feeling:

"Oh, my son, what have they driven you to..." He exhaled a concentrated cloud of alcoholic fumes and added regretfully, "But I will no longer participate in this. Enough! I will not sign up for what they plan to do with your lost, criminal souls. From now on, I will only pray that the Lord will guide you to the true path."

For a long time, I teetered on the edge of being and consciousness, and, waking up once again, I saw by my bed those from whose apartment I had jumped in the hopes of ending my life. Bent over my bed were the worried face of D.B. DaSilva, the beard of Rubinstein, and the ascetic, consumptive visage of Z. Dolin, who seemed about to burn out my only eye with his ever-present cigar.

"Our young friend!" one of them said. "The people's hearts were filled with noble anger when they learned your true story, and the government lost its last chance at re-election. It collapsed and will never rise again. You have done a good service to the sacred cause of human liberation."

I shuddered at such a pompous speech, and I said with bitterness:

“I would do you an even greater service if I kicked the bucket altogether, you lying, dirty politicians.”

I intended to angrily fling these revelations in their faces. In reality, all I could manage was a series of wheezing, gurgling, and inarticulate moans. They took my "fiery" speech as approval of their own clever moves and enthusiastically handed me a stack of newspaper clippings. In one of them, I saw myself, bloodied and unconscious, on a stretcher, surrounded by orderlies, police, and some people with eyes wide open in horror. I scanned the headlines, which excitedly proclaimed:

"A YOUNG VICTIM OF A CRIMINAL REFORMIST CONSPIRACY," "THE GOVERNMENT IS A KILLER," and "CRIMINALS IN POWER."

In one of the photographs, I recognized the Minister with a rather confused expression. Underneath it was the caption:

"DOWN WITH THE DEVIL IN MINISTER'S GUIDE! OUT! OUT! OUT!"

I shifted uncomfortably, and the nurse warned me sternly:

"The victim mustn't be disturbed. Look how upset he is. The visit is over. Please leave."

Whether I was truly still very weak, or whether these clowns had simply worn me out, I once again sank into darkness, illuminated by the brightest flashes of fragmentary dreams. For example, I imagined myself being turned inside out, gutted, thoroughly washed, and then filled again with some pure, completely new substance. Then I dreamed I was tearing through the streets in a powerful sports car, not on the highway, but right along the streets and sidewalks of a town, delighting in running over frightened pedestrians, feeling neither pain nor fear... In another dream, I laid a friendly nurse down in the middle of a ward and gave her an intrauterine infusion. She received me with pleasure, and the police officers, Brodskys, ministers, chaplains, politicians, and other "oranges" gathered around enthusiastically applauded us...

When I woke up, I saw a scowling phaser and a mom sobbing inconsolably. Not a single chord twitched within me, and I asked indifferently:

— So, how's your new son, Joe, doing? I hope he's making his mom and dad happy?

“Oh, Alex, my son,” Mom began to wail, and her father said reproachfully:

\- Well, why are you like this... Yes, he had some trouble with the police, son.

— What are you saying? What a pity! Give him my sincere condolences.

"Actually, it's not his fault. He never interfered in anything. He was just standing on the corner, waiting for his girlfriend. The police approached him and ordered him to move. He said he was a free citizen and had the right to stand wherever he wanted. Then they jumped on him and beat him up real bad. Then they threw him in a car and drove him somewhere out of town... When he got home, we barely recognized him. He went back to his old place. So your room is free..."

— …and you want me to come back and have everything be as before?

\- Yes, Sunny. Exactly. Please don't refuse. Okay?

\- Okay. I think I'll think about your offer.

\- Ooooh! - Mom howled again, and I exploded:

— Shut up! I beg you, or I'll help you...

And, lo and behold! This unintentional rudeness, brothers, somehow made me feel better. Perhaps, while I was sleeping, my tainted blood really had been replaced? It seemed so: the worse I was, the better off I was. Interesting! My intellectual friends had been telling me something similar. Or perhaps I was already a revolutionary?

"You shouldn't talk to your mother like that," my father said disapprovingly. "After all, she brought you into this world."

"Add: into a dirty, stinking, merciless world where man is a wolf to man. However, I didn't ask her for this favor." I tiredly closed my eyes and added conciliatorily, "Okay, go. I'll think about coming back. Only now everything will be different."

"Yes, son. It will be as you say," Dad hastily agreed. "Just get well soon."

Mother came closer and kissed me on the forehead, showering me with hot tears.

When they finally left, I lay there, trying to piece together my disorganized thoughts and feelings. Some kind of metamorphosis was definitely happening to me. The nurse I'd so successfully had sex with in my dream entered the room. She straightened my bed, and I asked:

\- How long have I been lying here, baby?

“Almost a week now, baby,” she replied, shooting a coquettish glance.

\- And what did you do to me here?

"They put you back together piece by piece. You have multiple fractures and you've lost a lot of blood. You also have a severe concussion. They had to give you direct transfusions from multiple donors."

"Have they been rummaging through my brain? I'm having some strange sensations and associations."

— Everything that was done to you was done solely for your benefit.

"There were no missing parts?" I smiled.

“No, you have everything in place,” she smiled playfully in response.

“When I recover a bit, you and I will check it out,” I promised.

A couple of days later, two young doctors came into my room with sweet smiley faces plastered on their faces. One of them opened a children's book with pictures in front of me and said cheerfully:

\- Look at this and tell us what is depicted here. Okay?

— What is this? A cretinism test, friends?

They looked confused, then laughed tensely.

\- No, we want to send you into space.

“I’ve already been there,” I muttered sullenly.

\- Look here. What is this?

One of them pointed to a photograph of a bird's nest with eggs.

\- What's hanging between your legs.

\- Well, seriously?

\- A nest, and eggs in it, if that's what you really want.

\- And what would you like to do with them?

— I'd like to smash them to smithereens over your head. That would be fun!

“Wonderful,” they perked up and showed me the next picture.

\- And what kind of goose is this?

"Not a goose, but a peacock," I corrected him. "I'd definitely pluck all of that one's feathers to keep him from getting cocky."

"Okay, good. Okay, okay," they croaked contentedly, continuing to show me different pictures and testing my reaction.

From birds and animals, they moved on to people. They showed a few swell girls, and I openly admitted I'd like to fuck them right there. Then there were scenes of well-dressed men being beaten, and I said I'd gladly help these guys bleed these overfed bourgeois. Finally, they showed me a naked, bearded man (I think he was the same one I saw in the Bible in the prison chaplain's office) carrying a huge cross to the top of a hill.

When asked what I would do, I answered with irritation:

— I would ask for a hammer and nails.

I was getting pretty fed up with these enema tubes and their tactility, so I asked point blank:

— Well, how is it? Are you satisfied? What's wrong with me?

"Deep hypnopedia," one of them cursed, and the second added, "Rejoice, boy, you're absolutely healthy!"

"Healthy?!" I exploded. "And you call me healthy when I'm smashed to pieces?"

"Oh, it's nothing," they reassured me. "Just lie down for a bit and you'll get up."

And indeed! My health improved by leaps and bounds. They fed me excellently, and a few days later I tried to push a nurse onto my bed for the first time, but she laughed it off. A few days later, she told me I was going to have a very large bump that day.

“I already have it,” I smiled, placing her hand on the blanket.

"You only have one thing on your mind, stupid. I'm serious. We have a very important visitor today. Everyone's been on edge since this morning."

"Who the hell will this bring?" I asked in surprise.

“You’ll see for yourself soon,” she answered evasively, combing my overgrown crew cut.

And I saw, my friends and brothers!

At two thirty in the afternoon, a nervous gang of newspapermen, cameramen, and other writers and photographers burst into my room. And then, surrounded by doctors, amidst a trumpet blast, a stately and imposing… Minister!

With a dazzling six-by-nine smiley face, he handed your poor narrator a well-groomed hand with manicured nails and cheerfully said, looking at the TV and camera:

— Hello, boy! How are you feeling?

— And yours, you son of a bitch? It's been a while, you stinking pus!

No one around heard, or if they did, understood, the warm greeting from "a man of the people to his leader." The beaming "leader"'s jaw dropped in astonishment, but he snapped it shut again, lest his momentary confusion, God forbid, end up in the papers. Then someone whispered in my ear in a friendly tone:

\- Don't forget who you're talking to, bastard.

"Fuck you," I grinned. "I'd see you in a coffin with your stinking minister."

"Don't bother the poor guy," the Minister said quickly. "He's talking to me like a friend. We're friends, aren't we, Alex-boy?"

\- Uh-huh! I'm a friend to everyone except my enemies.

"And who are your enemies, son?" asked the Minister, while the reporters began scribbling away and shoving tape recorders into my nostrils.

\- Everyone who caused me pain and suffering.

"Well, we'll get to the bottom of that," the Minister said, sitting down on the edge of my bed. "I and my government, of which I am a member, would like you to consider us your friends. Yes, we are your friends, lad. Don't we always look out for you and those like you?"

"Wow, that's some care! I wish the devils would take such good care of you in the next world!"

"Are you getting poor treatment after that accident? It was an accident, wasn't it?" he persisted, hypnotizing me with his wolfish eyes.

“Well, there’s no happiness here,” I said less confidently.

"You see," he continued. "We never wished you harm, unlike some. You probably know who I'm talking about. Yes, exactly. They wanted to exploit your inexperience and lack of sophistication for their own political ends. Those shameless scoundrels would have been only too glad to see you dead, since all the blame could have been placed on the government, which is giving its last shirt to the noble cause of educating the younger generation."

I looked at his thousand-dollar suite with disbelief.

"You're probably familiar with the name F. Alexander," the Minister continued to brainwash me. "That vile scoundrel, that unprincipled libeler, was thirsting for your blood. He was obsessed with the insane idea of chopping you into pieces, roasting you over a slow fire, and God knows what else. But now you're saved. We've placed him in a suitable institution."

“But he treated me like a friend, looked after me like a mother would a sick child…” I said sadly, feeling that this was where he got to me.

"He learned that you had done something terrible to his family in the past. Or rather, that's how it was presented to him," the Minister quickly corrected himself, noticing how I had suddenly turned pale. "In any case, he's gotten it into his head that you were responsible for the death of one of his closest friends."

“That’s what they told him,” I said vaguely.

"So, revenge became an obsession for him, his only goal in life. We had to isolate him for his own safety... and yours too."

"That was very thoughtful of you. He really was dangerous."

"When you get out of here," the Minister continued enthusiastically, "you won't have anything to worry about. I'll personally make sure you get a good job with a decent salary. You've been a great help to us, lad."

“Me to you?” I was surprised.

— We always help our friends and supporters!

Then someone shouted, "Smile!" and I automatically grinned. Cameras crackled and flashes flashed, capturing this momentous occasion.

"You're a great guy, Alex," this great man patted me on the shoulder approvingly. "And now a small gift from the government."

Two tough guys, whom I'd rather not meet without a lawyer or, at the very least, without my cutter in my pocket, brought in a large, shiny box. It was a magnificent stereo system. They placed it next to the bed, unpacked it, and plugged it in.

"So, what should I play for you?" asked a strange man in glasses. He was holding a whole stack of shiny new discs. "Mozart? Beethoven? Schoenberg? Carl Orff?"

“The ninth, the choral one,” I whispered, enchanted.

Divine chords began to play. The crowd began to slowly disperse. I leaned back against the pillows and blissfully closed my eyes. "A smart, quick-witted fellow," the Minister said as he left. Only two people remained in the ward: a bespectacled man and a nurse. The man timidly touched my sleeve:

— Please sign here.

I opened the documents and obediently signed them without even looking at what they were. I didn't really care.

The nurse gave me a promising smile and followed the bespectacled man out. Ludwig Ivan and I were left alone.

Its mournful, solemn music lifted me up and carried me along, just like in the good old days. When the scherzo began, I saw myself running across a vast, boundless sea, slashing with my cutter the world's face, distorted by a grimace of pain. Finally, I was healthy again.
