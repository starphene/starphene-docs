Project hub

**Realistic sleep deprivation game** 
**\
`	`Core concept is shifting between dream world (rpg game) and real world (random jobs as random fun puzzles) with some characters being present both in the real world and in-game world 

**Gunslugs-like game about atlanticism** 

**Game where you explore different racist and generally bad stories and fight writers, pushy executives, censorship, racism, etc**

**A game about different types of birds beating the shit out of eachother (crows vs owls for example)** 

**Game where you travel through procedually generated universes**

Game where you play as a starblood stuck in a simulation as punishment for some sort of crime and get brainwashed and gaslighted by the simulation.

**Top-down 2d shooter structured like an RDR game set in 2040's in the starbloods universe. Deep layered story, give the player "limitless" side activities involving randomly generated zones to clear, add procedually generated conversations (oblivion style but with more attention to background), add more setting-relevant gameplay variety, give the player ultimate freedom of choice (fnv style), possibly compromise hard sci-fi coded setting for the sake of increasing gameplay variety** 

**Paint tool-stylized RPG (maybe roguelike)** 

**Undertale style roguelike**

**Townsmen clone** 

**Game with chess themes and combat including mini chess matches with enemies. The board would have no more than 36 tiles for regular enemies, the player would only be given some of the OG chess unit types per battle. Each unit would have upgrades the player would be able to find or buy (like pawns that move sideways but eat forwards). Would include triangular, rhombic (square but sideways), hexagonal and octagonal variants (just the square version but between each corner there's an extra rotated square which would be used for something; each variant would get its own area), ~40-50 total sub-unit types, a customizable versus mode against an AI opponent or a local human opponent as a separate mode. The story would be about a rook which would get tired of not allowing to lead anything with their minions sometimes violating the rules and the final boss possibly involving it swapping pieces between eachother randomly creating a really fun climax like tenna and his minigames. Possible plot direction where you and enemies can cheat there's a central AI that decides these disputes causing the loser to skip their turn, and with this central ai going corrupt and favoring the main antagonist in disputes by gaslighting you and unfairly taking the main antagonist's stance**

**A pvz clone about wizards, skeletons (instead of zombies) and spirits (who defend the lawn).** 

**You're a part of a council of ghosts who go around protecting people's property from invading skeletons and necromancers while haunting furniture and home items to use as a substitute for plants in different environments, conditions and predicaments, with the game taking an angle of absurdist humor in its general theme and having the skeletons be very goofy and hilarious.** 

**Free new worlds, free PVP + matchmaking dlc, paid randomizer and chaos mod dlc, paid level creator dlc**

`	`Planned to be action packed like pvz1, with minigames, spirit stat randomizer mode, difficulty modes, expensive ability to combine spirits together to get something nasty, and maybe more. 

**Something pokemon inspired?** 

**A roguelike which randomly generates an undertale like game from one of many templates** 

**Undertale like game with a lot of soul modes and a lot of cool fights, described above. (plus a sequel, a prequel and a same universe MMORPG spinoff) (probably actually gonna instead focus on a long story that keeps the player on track with new characters, challenges and mechanics)** 

**Mechatale (undertale fangame, but with mainly robots)** 

**Deltarune/deltatraveler-like game about guys who travel through universes and insane places and stuff so they could save these places and become powerful along the way, and they start going through bad and racist universes, fighting writers with god powers, with me explicitly abusing the main characters**

**A game about 7 teens going on a vacation and getting isekai'd and gaining magical powers to slay beasts, inspired by sea of stars and deltarune**

**Terraria/Starbound like game (maybe?)**

**Class selection would be replaced with the player getting 4 attack stats to choose from, and the player would be encouraged to pick 2 out of 4, resulting in 6 possible progression paths.** 

**Maybe noita like customizable magic system. Maybe general customuzability for all weapons.** 
Melee will only be true melee pretty much
There would be a summoner class which would have be player attack using defeated enemies
Ranged weapons would have a few customizable components

**DS3 clone (might be too expensive)**

**FNV-like game set in russia (might be too expensive)**
