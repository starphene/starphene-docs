For sequel:

Tons of choice 

Set in homeland of Entropy, technologically in ~1900 and culturally in ~1850s; have been dealing with quasars for ages through powerful teams; have human batteries made out of red brighteye fusions; there's more rituals akin to fusion and brighteye awakening 

The story involves entropy finding what happened to her family and maybe doing something with them; a more technologically advanced civilization (possibly alien) invading; different kinda crisees not explored in the first installment; a guy from outer space and a fake green brighteye who came to the planet on a vacation who joins entropy's party, disobeys, then eventually parts ways due to loving freedom too much, trolls entropy by stealing and messing with her including recruiting her former allies. They both represent 2 beings who wanna play with the world in their own way and can't share it, so there's 1 fight where the alien fights using only locally provided means and 1 where they fight using alien technology as the climactic final boss (but entropy has just defeated a different invasion from a different faction so she's properly geared for the fight) 

Advanced system for relationships with npcs and possibly party members

Entropy reshaping her goals to become a guardian angel who protects the plain man from tyranny. 

One of the main villains is a giant ball amalgamation of heliumic beings who is stuck in circular logic loops, has the power to change reality to make what is false true, and sometimes corrupts players teleports forcing absurdist looney tunes shit to start happening and sometimes sends shapeshifting images of entropy's past experiences to fight her. She also used to be entropy's abusive mother

Nebulae/Helium (Sprite): semi-conscious magical essense of the Everscript which are microscopic beings attracted to sentience which serve as a source for all imagination. When a biological being is born, Helium sprites begin entering the target's consciousness at a speed decreasing in hyperbolic pattern, not just humanoids. 

Stars/eyebright: when a human (or an animal) goes through the Ascention ritual where they sniff a ton of aromatic substances, something happens to them based on the amount of helium in their body. The longer their helium count is, the longer their abilities last before running out, and the shorter their beaconeye (period of a massive increase in power before end of their eyebright career) phase lasts. After the death of both the body and soul of a eyebright, their helium returns to the broader world. 

87%: nothing happens, these people go back to daily lives

10%: become class 1 eyebrights, gaining small potency helium magic and increased vitality and greatly reduced senescence. Serve as regular troopers and equipment masters. Eyes shine red. At around 150 years old if they survive this long, they begin losing their sentience and get their minds reduced pretty much entirely to habits and muscle memory, have their eye color shift to white to blue and gain increased magical prowess. After losing their minds, they can remain “alive” for thousands of years before dying. 

2%: become class 2 eyebrights, proper magic users. After ~25 years become beacons for ~5 years until eventually they deal their final blow, losing most of their magical strength and starting to slowly stop caring about the material world, becoming helium spirits after death. Eyes shine orange and yellow. 

0\.5%: become class 3 eyebrights, powerful magic users, can create golems. After ~5 years become beacons for ~4 months, after which same thing happens as with class 2 but more potent, and their final attack becomes extremely powerful and devastating (it can also not happen at all). Become helium wraiths on death. Eyes shine white. 

0\.1%: become class 4 eyebrights, supreme magic users. Take only around a year before turning beacon, then around a week before becoming a void shade. Eyes shine light blue.

White Dwarves/Helium Spirit: when a class 2 to 3 eyebright dies, a helium spirit leaves their body to live in the wilderness and mostly chill out until they slowly vane into nonexistence. They're shiny ghosts made of helium mimicking their original hosts

Neutron Star/Helium Wraith: powerful and biologically immortal hostile helium spirits which pursue violent goals after death of a class 3 eyebright.

Pulsar/: a class 3 post-eyebright which gets killed instead of dying of natural causes. Extra strong and pissed off. 

Magnetar/: when very rare class 3 eyebrights bordering with class 4 run out of lifetime as an eyebright, they become infatuated with a glimpse into what they consider a perfect world and begin doing their best to make it a reality. Near-immortal after collapse as eyebrights, only leaving the husks they had pre-undeath if it decays enough or is rendered unusable, and are also even more powerful. 

Quark Star/Helium Shade: normally impossible unless it's the second cataclysm, result after a brighteye above void shade threshold runs out of helium. Transforms host in an ordered way opposite of how void shade transformations work and has a god complex. 

Black hole/Void Shade: when a class 4 beaconeye reaches end of life, they start going through an emotional hell until they're forced to release an extremely powerful magic attack which quickly turns them into an undead void shade. Their helium gets turned into nihilium, a corrupted anti form of helium, and it either transforms the wearer into an abominable beast or makes them lose themselves in hunger for something (usually helium-based beings or other void shades) or most of the time both. They are biologically immortal and don't need sleep or food, but they do \*want\* traditional food. Eating enough helium or nihilium can grow a void shade in power to an insane degree.

Quasar/Ouroborus or Black Hunger: a corrupted cross between a void shade and a brighteye, possessing both helium and nihilium. Capable of using both brighteye and void shade magic, always retains full consciousness after formation, and can puppet control any defeated helium-based being, but starts off relatively weak. They need to consume both traditional food and heliumic or nihiliumic entities (and a lot of both) or their helium and nihilium begins leaving their body, the shade gradually loses consciousness and essentially starves to death. Grows in power much faster than normal void shades, and if it gets strong enough, it becomes strong enough to destroy civilization, which happens around once every millenia, always followed by the shade starving to death. 

Planet/Golem: an artificial sapient and semi-sentient being made by a powerful eyebright (or eyebrights) or void shade surrendering some of their helium or nihilium. Their desires are shaped by the creator, but if it's made by a void shade, the entire purpose of its existence becomes feeding the creator, and after they're gone, they begin aimlessly wandering the world. Otherwise, they gain free will but don't usually go causing havoc. 

Speak with a specific recurring type of error in speech

Maleficium laundry squad (Entropy's home continent) or shadehunter crew: the parties which hunt void shades. New to the local continent, Entropy has actually brought them to it; are way more powerful at fighting than armies of red eyebrights especially in terms of void shade hunting. Are also very good at taking over small kingdoms which the rulers of these kingdoms aren't really aware of. It's niche but known knowledge about their efficiency but they're far from mainstream

Everscript: the metaphysical library which contains all information that can exist 

The Projection: a parallel dimension existing sort of outside of time, sort of not. The Everscript projects onto it, which makes it full of an infinitely large plethora of random shit from wonderful beauty to reality bending terrors. At the end of the game, an Ouroborous would discover and destroy a seal preventing the realm from leaking into the Spiral, causing the endgame crisis.

The Ascention Gate: when a being goes through an ascention ritual, it physically enters this subsection of the projection. It's an individualized trial ground which forces a user to go through an individualized gauntlet of challenges built based on personality, likes and dislikes. If you die during the gauntlet, you die in real life, and if you win, you get a random brighteye category, or none at all. After you're done with it, an infinismall amount of time passes in the physical world and your body is teleported back to where you were put into the ritual.
The Spiral: the physical world
Vitamor: the planet where the game actually happens
Osiris: the continent where the game actually happens

Timeline:

0 - Mastermind is born into a poor merchant family 

19 - Mastermind goes through the ascention ritual, becomes a category 1 brighteye, joins the army

26 - Mastermind deserts the army along with his army friends, try to settle down and fail, being eventually forced to pretend to be city guards of a coastal town

28 - Entropy, a 20 year old girl freshly turned void shade arrives on a boat from a far away land (she was exiled for her condition) and begins causing chaos and destruction right after leaving it (she's sanguine and maniacal at this point because blah blah emotional pain). Her, Mastermind and a category 2 brighteye deserter named Sunbird (placeholder for now) agree to form a group together (team kaunan) so they could demilitarize society by establishing a network of similar groups all over the land to combat undead threat on their own and make it so red brighteyes never have to go to war ever (because that's how it works in the land cerry is from, with upper category brighteyes exclusively working in such teams while the lower category ones fight eachother). It goes well at first, cerry goes through a few psychotic episodes where she burns down a few houses in void flame for no reason, but thanks to support from the rest of the group she stabilizes into a somewhat sane person. With success, they gain money and visibility, and establish other shade slaying teams from powerful deserters and hermits. 

29 - several teams turn to banditry in a chain reaction. The original team has to stop one of them (team Naudiz) first as they burn a village, then another (team Raido) as they assault a castle to take over an entire kingdom. A category 4 beaconeye kills all their allies and fights team alpha, then as they turn into a black shade, they pulverize Sunbird in a single blast, and after the shade is defeated, Sunbird's death causes a chain reaction leading to a relatively fast collapse of the whole operation. In the moment, the remaining two get an option to 

31 - by this point, pretty much the entire operation crumbles, and Entropy at last loses faith in resurrecting it and parts ways with Mastermind to look for some other way to spend her undeath. She creates a visually human-like flesh golem named Envoy of Serenity (because the end goal is peaceful life) and gifts them to Mastermind as a parting gift. 

143 - Team E2 under the orders of Mastermind stages a sting operation to lure Team Othala to Castle Steeltooth. The reasons behind this decision was a refusal to work for the Mastermind in the past. After faking a threat of a void shade king and meticulously luring them to Castle Steeltooth, Quron and Jerry stay behind to kill reinfocements while Arry1 and Arry2 fall to/defeat the Envoy. Whatever happens, the Envoy casts a consciousness and memory blocking magic fog and captures Arry1 and Arry2 without any issues. Quron and Jerry get captured with a lot more of a fight, but still in the end suffer the same fate. The Envoy and E2 bring the captured Brighteyes to the Mastermind (wields 4 swords, 2 bows or just uses fists), who is now inside a 4-armed 3m-tall marvel of golemionics. He orders E2 and the Envoy to experiment with crossing Arry1 and Arry2 together, aswell as Quron with a captured minor void shade and Jerry with a captured helium wraith, then leaves to continue with his business. Jerry and Arry get fused into existence successfully and they remain unconscious, but the fusion which makes up Quron wakes up from the fog-induced sleep due to Void Shades being immune to dark magic, breaks free from restraints, and attacks the Envoy. Noticing themself outmatched, the Envoy flees. Quron keeps Arry in a magical sleep for several weeks and in the meantime sets Jerry into the wild similar to how Arry was set out into the wild near the Onyx Mountain to scavenge everything left dead by Jerry. Eventually, his new gang caught onto the scheme, and he was forced to fall back on Arry as a plan B to do the same thing as before but with nuance. 

1: blabla. They go to

Prologue: Light blue and red eyebrights (plus a different white brighteye), later explained to be a part of Team Othala storm a castle of a tyrannical monarch (which also serves as a tutorial and a place to test the players skill level, with 3 or 4 guards prior to the final battle serving as a tutorial to get a hang of controls and the king himself serving to test the player’s baseline skill and assign them a difficulty). They talk like the player was put at the end of a final mission of a different game. 

Characters of interest:

Arry1 (light blue brighteye) 

Arry2 (red brighteye) 

Jerry (white brighteye) 

The King (has an eyepatch and is rigged to win while having an option of losing and having the gang fight a different version of him later) 

Part 1: A carriage drives Arry (placeholder name for protag, combined of 2 main characters from before, and they also have no idea what happened to them or what they're doing) to an azure forest infested with bandits and deserters, and after defeating the chief there's a deep cave + abandoned prison patrolled by shade golems and infested with a void shade, with the bandits kidnapping people to feed them. Near the bandit camp Arry meets Barry (placeholder name for party member 2), a yellow-eyed brighteye, a vigilante fighting bandits, who offers to join Arry, officially forming Team Algiz. Inside the cave, they meet Cerry (placeholder name for party member 3, secretly a void shade) on a side path which is actually narratively a main path as the real main path is blocked off by a giant cliff only golems can climb, and she gives Arry and Barry an explanation that she is hiding in the cave away from the outside world and surviving off of corpses stolen from the greater void shade and turns hostile to prevent Arry and Barry from talking. After they emerge victorious, she runs away, and after they leave the cave to return to the outside world, they catch her on the way out, and Barry offers her to join the party because she's hot, which she accepts as she has nothing better to do. 

Characters of interest:

Party Member: Arry (struggles with being self for the entire duration) 

Bandit Peon (rusty sword and rocks) 

Bandit Marksman (bow and explosives) 

Bandit Warrior (sword and wooden shield) (all 3 have a chance to be red brighteyes) 

Party Member: Barry (yellow brighteye, deserted veteran fighter, secretly light blue, femboy vigilante outlaw) 

Miniboss: Bandit Chief (yellow brighteye) + Bandit Assassin (double daggers) 

Void Golem 1

Void Golem 2

Void Golem 3

Void Golem 4 

Cerry (katana) (has a bluish skin) 

Nave-esproc (void shade, legs split into 4 each to resemble spider ones, upper half of the rest of the body is split into 2 halves by a mouth forming across it (left arm is under the lower lip and the right arm is above the upper lip), the lower half takes over the function of the neck, the arms themselves are turned into hungry snakes). Esproc is a name addition assigned to every void shade out there, it's corpse backwards. 

Qurom (former team member of arry1 and arry2, formerly yellow-white brighteye who fused with a void shade on purpose) 


Part 2: the gang uses disguises to sneak into Bluelight, the only major settlement of Cerulean Trees, the micronation in question, which is used as a local hub and a safe zone with lore and shops and stuff. They rent a room in an inn, Cerry volunteers to help to see what's wrong with Arry, she's surprised by their nature but can't really do much to help. Everyone sleeps, allowing Arry to have their two halves talk to eachother in a white space and actually agree to not hog control from one another to figure out what happened to them and how they can move on. 

Quron, former member of Arry's previous crew, shows himself to Arry, supports them after the tragedy, explains how there's a more powerful crew which destroys any other groups that emerge called Team Mannaz. 


Plan: make it so the whole prestory and story were orchestrated by one very old red eyebright who wanted to seize control over several minikingdoms and build a giant one

Part 2: An abandoned estate with sapient brighteye big cats and birds of prey (which can't properly form civilization because of no fingers), occupying different parts of the estate. The basement has a void shade which can use the geometry to its advantage in battle. 

Part 3: Ancient ruins infested with helium wraiths. Erry joins the party here, and the gang finds out the truth about the player's creation and Quron's betrayal thanks to Cerry recognizing the area due to working in it while in team alpha. 

Part 4: A temporary incursion past walls of a bigger kingdom which has more advanced golems and everything, all for the purpose

Part 5: A castle full of brighteyes up to cat 3 and golems with cerry's puppet golem at the end pretending to be a monarch planted by mastermind. Entropy successfully orders the golem to stand down and join the party, and renames them to Exoneration. Erry tries to kill Cerry and is then defeated in a 1 on 1 battle. 

Part 6: Quasar guy using puppet brighteyes, including a light blue one as a decoy to distract the main team from him. Barry also goes void shade here and is forced to either be killed or sealed away

Part 7: Quasar guy's actual fight (with more puppets and mini void shades surrounding the area) 

Initially, Entropy remains ahead of the Ouroborous in terms of thinking and planning. However, eventually he hits a point where he becomes smarter and more knowledgeable than her, leading to internal conflict within Entropy. Eventually, the Ouroborous would discover the seal keeping the Projection from leaking onto the Spiral, then break it so he could devour the Projection or whatever comes out of it. After destroying the seal, he would fight the main party and lose, triggering the endgame crisis with helium shades, mini void shades and impossible brighteyes

Part 8: Blue primal super eyebright

Part 9: The final boss which is a big helium entity of some sort idk, can probably traverse universes and shit

Mastermind becomes a fusion of himself and a golem between dlc and game

Striggs's origin:

\*a small army of 100 soldiers are ordered to fight in a generic war over resources between Stingdew Kingdom and a neighboring Guild of the Black Arrow (mercs). Despite outnumbering the enemy 5 to 1, the Stingdew army takes 78 entire casualties. Their commander is a bitter unpleasant bluish-white brighteye lady.\*

Migranda: Fierce drones, I congratulate you with another successful battle! The Guild of the Black Arrow has been a substantial nuisance to our glorious land of Stingdew, and you have successfully eliminated them! Seventy eight of you may have died, but their sacrifice shall not be in vain. We shall mourn our dead and give them their proper honorary burial in honey, as they faced death with no fear in their hearts and no traitorous thoughts in their minds. Now get some rest, drones! In a week, when we get reinforcements, I shall lead you into another battle, and we'll show our enemies the might of the Honeysting Kingdom! Buzzah! 

Everyone: Buzzah! 

Migranda: I need to visit the capital for some official business. You, and you. \*points fingers\*. What are your names? 

\*past Starling and Drone 40 which are whitish-yellow drones kneel\* Drone 70. Drone 40. (they're actually 70 F3 and 40 F3) 

Migranda: You are now drones 10 F3 \*points at previously drone 40\* and 20 F3, and you are now in charge. Prepare the drones for the upcoming battles. Her Majesty is counting on you. \*she then leaves\*

Some time passes, and lower brighteyes are seen camping around a campfire and eating meat quietly. It's midnight. Everyone looks stressed. 

Red brighteye 1, cooking some meat on a stick: I can't believe we won. I shouldn't be alive. I saw my brother, his best friend Mike, my… my friend Samantha… 

Future Striggs red brighteye: We outnumbered them five to one, and yet they cleaved through our brothers and sisters like butter before they finally succumbed. I feel so worthless, so powerless… Like a fading star in the endless sea of space… Like the tiniest stain on the parchment of the world's history. 

Red brighteye 2: I am with B- sorry, Drone 17… I feel so wrong for being alive. Why am I alive? What is life? 

Orange brighteye: We need to find a way to let off this tension… This collective feeling like the world is out to get us… 

Starling: \*stomps\* God fucking damn it, why are we doing this? Why? This is awful. The army is using is to clean off their pests, and what do we get in return? Servitude until death? A fancy burial and twenty combs to our families, at best? It's not worth it! 

\*everyone looks shocked and stares at him for a bit\*

Past Striggs: He has a point, actually. \*others agree\*

Red brighteye 1: I mean, I don't know. I am just so tired of walking and killing and struggling. Maybe we should just accept our fate as corpses, might be simpler that way. 

Starling: I know. I feel awful too. I can hear their screams in my ears every time I shut them up. But the reason you're feeling that way is because Migranda broke you. The Queen broke you. They used- no, planned to use you up and throw you away like rat-eaten shirt. I have had enough. Are we really going to allow being broken and discarded, or are we going to break our chains and take back our lives? 

Drone 10: You know you've just committed blasphemy against her Majesty, right? It's best we stop this right now before someone mentions this to Migranda and get us executed and turned into fertilizer to grow pollen for bees to harvest. 

Starling: Why? So we can march into the next battle and all get killed anyway? 

Drone 10: We swore an oath to the Queen to follow her every command and to sting our enemies until we die. To abandon our duty here would be breaking that oath and generally just treason. It's our sworn duty to die for her. 

Starling: We weren't given a choice to say said oath. We were unlucky enough to become Brighteyes at adulthood and forced into a contract for eternal servitude. We don't even get to keep our names!

Drone 10: This is unacceptable! One wrong move, and I'll talk about this to Migranda. Everyone who agrees with him are traitors. I warn you- \*a random ass orange brighteye lady picks up a bow and shoots him in the skull\*

The lady: And I warn you, that a mouse that supports the cat queen is a stupid mouse! \*walks up to the dead body and spits on it\*

Past Striggs: No turning back now. Let's do this!

Brighteye 2: What have you done… \*everyone looks happy, some less so than others, a few don't care\*

Starling: What any self-respecting brighteye should have done in her place. From this point on, we are no longer drones for the piece of garbage Queen or indebted to serve her for the rest of our lives. We leave and make a new life for ourselves! \*some cheer, others remain too dissociated to care\* We are no longer Drone 20 or Drone 6. We return to our own names we're given at birth! \*raises fist\* Actually, no, we get to choose the names we get from now on. You have until dawn to choose your own names before we all note them down and move the hell out of this cursed land! \*raises fist again, cheering reignites\* I have already made up my mind. My new name is now Starling, as we are now free, like the stars in the sky, who answer to no despot!

\*title card with Starling, the one full of mirth\*

Despite their newfound freedom, the deserters, now named the Soaring Shrikes, were forced to find out the hard way that freedom in life was far from free. 

\*the orange brighteye gal who kickstarted the whole process lies dead in a tent\*

\*Starling walks in, Striggs and some other red brighteye is inside\*

Starling: How is Maria faring? 

The other brighteye: Not great. I've learnt some healing skills from a book and I am a lot better at my job than before, but I still don't know what I can do. I tried pulling out the arrowhead, but when I did, she yelled out in pain and stopped responding suddenly. I can't even tell if she is dead or alive, the book doesn't say anything about this! We really need to find someone who actually knows what they're doing. I feel so bad for being so bad at my job… 

Starling: That's a tall order… 

Striggs: It has barely been a year and we're already down to 17 strong, 16 if she dies too. How long do we have to endure this, Stars? Was it really worth it? 

Starling: It was, advisor. And even if it wasn't, we have to keep pushing, keep trying. There's no turning back. We don't have a choice but to keep trying. 

Striggs: You know, I asked the Shrikes currently in camp what they thought about our discussion. 7 would be fine to rob others without bloodshed, 4 would be fine even with bloodshed, 3 would never agree under any circumstances. Come on, Stars. 

Starling: So what if everyone was in the first two groups? The answer is no either way. The moment we descend into banditry we lose our moral high ground and become hunted even harder. I know it doesn't look like it, but there is a way out which doesn't involve robbery. We just need to find it. 

Striggs: But… Okay. I trust you, Stars. 

The shitty doctor Shrike: The odds are clearly stacked against us. Everyone hates us already and we're constantly welcomed with open swords for the horrific crime of not enabling a tyrant. I don't know how we would make it out… Aren't you a little scared, sir? 

Starling: \*sigh\* It's my entire profession to pretend I am not. And I am not a sir. Only an F-class brighteye.

They tried many ways to settle down. Guilds, laborers, servants: eventually, it all failed. At some point, they developed a scheme to, to oversimplify, peacefully infiltrate the guard of a small coastal town of Let Me Name My Town Whatever I Want For Gods Sake, or Godsake for short as everyone actually called it. Luckily for them, there were no records kept about who was real and who was not. 

\*disguised Starling and Striggs patrol the streets\*

Striggs: Okay, but if you look on the bright side, we haven't been discovered. Nobody even suspects us. And we have never lasted 2 months without being discovered. Seriously, Stars, it's not so bad. 

Starling: Maybe you're right. It's hard to say. The transition from being a sovereign's plaything to having to watch half of anyone you ever cared about die over a year… I feel so guilty for allowing them all to die. For not doing more. 

Striggs: For me, it's the opposite. It's becoming harder and harder to care. To feel anything… When Flamerose succumbed to the black rot, I felt so wrong for not feeling anything… I can feel the world feasting on my emotions and leaving a blank, empty slate behind. But I know it's all just the fallout. We're safe. We're good. 

Starling: I hope you're right… 

\*they saw a lot of people sprinting from the docks\*

Random guard: TO ARMS! TO ARMS! TO ARMS! 

Striggs: Should we? 

Starling: Why not. It came from the docks, it's probably just pirates, nothing the brighteyes can handle. Let's move! 

\*they sprint towards action, and it's younger Entropy massacring random people, she still has an eyepatch\*

Entropy: DIE! DIE! BURN IN HELL! I HATE YOU! STOP CALLING ME A BASTARD, I AM ALSO HUMANOID, JUST LIKE YOU! DIE! 

\*Striggs and Stars pause to observe what's happening\*

Striggs: This is bad, she is unfathomably strong for a pirate. 

Starling: Yeah… 

\*a few more guards run up to the sides of the duo\*

Guard: Stars! Stars! We're here. Should we engage? 

Entropy: YOU! DECIDING WHENEVER TO FIGHT OR FLIGHT? FACE ME, YOU COWARDS! YOU CAN NEVER RUN AWAY! 

Starling: Worth the risk! If we win, their trust in us shall be forever assured. Show us what you got, pirate! 

Entropy: I WILL SLAUGHTER YOU LIKE THE PIGS YOU ARE! 

\*battle, entropy gets restrained\*

Entropy: LET GO OF ME! UNTIE ME! I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY! \*continues this\*

Striggs: \*hyperventilates\* I am never underestimating another pirate in my life again… What is this monster made of? 

Starling: Doesn't matter now. Help me tie her up better than this so we can bring her to jail. 

Civilian bystander: What terrifying magic… 

Non-Shrike guard bystander: Is that you, Henry and David? Where did you muster the strength to defeat anyone this powerful? 

Entropy: THEY CHEATED! THE LITTLE BASTARDS CHEATED, THEY DIDN'T PLAY FAIR! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE DEAD THE MOMENT I AM FREE! YOU HEAR ME? DEAD! YOU! DEEEEEEEAD! 

Striggs: Uh huh. 

Entropy: DO YOU NOT HEAR ME? MY NAME IS ENTROPY, AND I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU THE MOMENT I AM FREE! YOU FACELESS BOOTLICKERS OF SOME INBRED PIECE OF SHIT ROYAL WILL GET WHAT'S COMING! DON'T IGNORE ME, YOU PIECES OF SHIT! 

Starling: \*sigh\* Whatever. 

\*the shrikes tied up entropy proper, including the mouth, and brought her to the basement of a guard post\*

Non-shriek guard post captain, yellow brighteye: Are you the two that captured the rampaging wench? \*approaching Striggs and Starling\*

Starling: Yes, sir. Along with two others.

Captain: With your fancy spells? I used to find your story of a dishonored lieutenant punished with serving under a brighteye below your rank weird, but it seems a lot more likely now. Your shift is long over, how about we go out for a drink together and share some stories? You too, red eye. You two must have a fun story behind always sticking together. 

Starling: No, thanks, it's okay, you don't have to… 

Captain: Oh no, I do! The drinks are all on me! So is the food. \*taps starling’s shoulder\* You've earned a dinner above your stature today. Besides, I am sure you'd love a break from the disgusting slop I saw you two eat usually. 

\*Starling looks at striggs\* Striggs: Thank you for the offer. I don't see why not. We should be fine. I mean, the food should be fine. 

Starling: Yea, alright. I mean, you're too generous-

Captain: Ah, you can skip the gratuitous words. I'll take your gratitude in the form of life stories! 

\*later, when the duo enter the basement with entropy again\*

Starling: I just can't… The way they worship the royals… I feel like we shall always remain as the black sheep of society. 

Striggs: We wouldn't be the only ones. 

\*they enter Entropy's cell and striggs unties her mouth\*

Entropy: Unless you're here to slit my throat to spare me the execution, leave me alone, uniform. 

Starling: Did you lock the door? 

Striggs: \*nods, both sit near her\*

Starling: Good. Look, lady, we just wanted to talk. Not on behalf of the guard or the King, but on behalf of ourselves. 

Entropy: Don't know, don't care. Kill me or leave, pig. I want nothing to do with you. 

Starling: We were just here to ask what's the deal with your hatred of royals and uniforms! And why the massacre from earlier happened. That's all! 

Striggs: We're not here to judge. 

\*meanwhile evan, entropy's twin brother, wearing a twinkey haircut, a stoic face and an eyepatch, is seen following a couple of guards into the tower. He then enters\*

Guard 1: Whoa, whoa, where do you think-

\*evan absolutely annihilates the other guy by making his bones stab him from the inside, and approaches the other guard\*

Guard: What-

Evan, name not shown yet: \*grabs the guard by the throat and materializes a pair of dies with the right hand\* 

These are the dies which will determine your fate. If any of the dies land on the numbers from 1 to 6, I will painfully mutilate your right eye, left eye, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg as follows. If they land on snake eyes, your entire body will be pulverized. If you tell me where a young adult woman named Anne is imprisoned here, the dice shall not be rolled. 

\*the guard points left towards the basement's hatch, and evan fucking yeets the guard an entire meter away and approaches the hatch without an extra word\*

\*inside the basement\*

Entropy: ...which is why they all deserve to feel what I feel. The lower class brighteyes don't realize how much it sucks to be O-class! 

\*evan obliterates the trapdoor and slowly descends inside the temporary jail\*

Striggs: Who the fuck are you? 

Evan: This is all the introduction you're getting. \*pulls off eyepatch, revealing a light blue bright eye which illuminates the whole room\*

\*title card of ???, with 3 red skulls next to both sides of his name, and a caption of “with six red skulls next to his name because that's how much he dwarfs you in power level”\*

Striggs and Starling: HOLY FUCK! \*pull out swords instinctively\*

Entropy, at the same time: Oh, you two are three feet in the grave. Or I guess six feet, since there's two of you. 

\*the fight with evan involves the duo being only able to talk and use defensive abilities as actions as fighting would be pointless and running wouldn't be possible\*

\*after an attack lands\*

Entropy: Yes! Yes! Annihilate them! 

Evan: Shut the fuck up, Ann. 

Entropy: Sorry! I’m sorry! Please don't beat me after this is over. 

Striggs: We don't want to fight you! We also hate kings! 

Entropy: Not up to you to decide. Should have cowered and hid while I was slaughtering your comrades! Now, you die! 

Starling: We're not even guards! We're just imposters! 

Entropy: Now you're just saying nonsense to get out of being decimated. Ever heard an expression, “a pig can never escape the slaughterhouse”?

Starling and Striggs: No! 

Entropy: Ah, don't worry. Soon, you won't be able to hear anything at all!

Evan: One more word and you won't ever be able to say anything ever again. 

Entropy: \*face of genuine fear\*

Striggs: We're deserters pretending to be guards!

Starling: Yes! Why are we even fighting?

\*the fight pauses, Evan approaches Starling, grabs him by the right arm and holds him up\*

Evan: You have until I take 10 breaths to explain yourself. 

Starling: We… Deserters… Kingdom… \*he is not in a comfortable position to speak\*

Striggs: We deserted from a kingdom northeast from here as a large group and fled here to dress up as guards so people stop stigmatizing us and killing us. I swear.

\*evan puts down starling, turns around, obliterates a guard eavesdropping from above the trapdoor, causing him to plop into the jail\*

Starling: What… What are you guys here for? Top category brighteyes tired of following orders on a rampage? 

Entropy: Almost correct. Come to me, I'll show you something. 

\*Starling approaches entropy\* Starling: Yea? 

Evan: What do you think you're trying to do, you idiot!? 

Entropy: Actually, yea, maybe we should close the trapdoor above so nobody can hear us. We're exchanging sensitive information here. 

Striggs: I know a more secure location for this. We can talk there. 

Starling: \*tilts head\* Striggs, it's meant to be a sensitive location! Unless you mean… 

Striggs: No, not that one. The one which we… 

Starling: Yea, yea, that one shall do. \*frees entropy\* I feel bad cutting these ropes, I spent so long tying them together. 

Entropy: I doubt you'll regret freeing me. If we fight again, I'll do my best to leave you alive. 

Starling: Thanks… So, we usually go to that location after dark to avoid attention, but… 

Evan: We are not waiting. Lead. \*he points at the exit\*

Striggs: But the guards, the broad daylight, the attention… 

Entropy: Hardly an issue. 

Starling: Mmm… Okay. Follow me. 

\*evan puts eyepatch back on. after they reach a deserted abandoned house, some guard is chilling inside and drinking wine; entropy and the guard draw swords the moment they see eachother\*

Starling: Simmer down, everyone. \*makes a hand gesture to deescalate situation\* That is a Soaring Shrike, one of ours. And these are a pair of psychos we found on the street. 

Entropy: I'll take that as a compliment. \*everyone sheathes their weapons\* This is the place, correct? 

Striggs: Yes. We can speak freely here. Talen, you can keep drinking your… presumably burglared wine. God damn it, people, how much do I have to remind you that this kinda shit puts us all in danger? 

Entropy: Look, just tell us your full story from the beginning, and we'll properly introduce ourselves. 

Starling: ...Okay. Striggs, mind doing it for me, in case I need to save my breath?

Striggs: Of course, Stars. Anyway…

\*after he is over, everyone is sitting on the ground\*

Striggs:...and that's about where we are now. It's kind of hard to wrap our heads around that we're not dead yet, nor that we aren't in a serious danger of death. Until today, that is. 

Entropy: Well, alright. I am gonna be honest with you, you got very lucky with finding us. We’re in a similar predicament ourselves. You know my name already, and this death incarnate? She's my brother. \*evan's head slowly turns towards entropy with a loud stone scratching sound played over a deafening silence\* Sorry. Sorry. \*He's\* my brother. 

Evan: Evan Gamaray. \*looks to the side, dissociated\*

Entropy: And I am Entropy, formerly Anna Gamaray! We're twins, both 22.

Striggs: Wait, so if you're both 22, and light blue brighteyes, does that mean… 

Entropy: Seems like someone didn't skip out their heliumics classes in school.

Striggs: (What the fuck is a school?...) 

Starling: (Heriumix… Skull…) 

Entropy: And here's the twist. \*pulls off eyepatch, revealing a void in place of the right eye, leaving everyone else terrified and leaving talen to drop his wine bottle on the floor in the back in shock\*

Evan: You dumb fucking donkey. \*side eyes entropy\*

Entropy: Void shade! Except I don't really feel void shadey. Depressed, yea. Pissed off, absolutely. In the mood for another mass murder, sure. Hungry, no. Not more than normal. 

Starling: Why… Why aren't you attacking? 

Striggs: Void shades are all monsters consumed by hunger, but how can you retain sapience? 

Entropy: In exceptional cases some void shades retain their sapience. I don't know why, but it's quite rare. Still, society doesn't care what kind of void shade you are. A normal one or the one like me, they'll hate you and want you dead for no other reason. It's the reason I was exiled to this ooga-boogsberg in the first place. 

\*the Shrikes calm down a lot\* Starling: Oh… if that's true, we understand how you feel. 

Entropy: See? That's the beauty of our acquaintance! We actually have a shared trauma! Listen, how do you guys fight void shades in these lands? The bad ones, I mean. 

Striggs: Same as anyone. Send lots of soldiers and hope they don't die. 

Entropy: \*shrugs\* And how's that working out for them? Are they not dying much? 

Striggs: \*shakes head\*

Entropy: Pathetic. What kind of a Loincloth Central have we arrived at… 

Evan: The mundane kind that nurtures snobs and oppresses the righteous. 

Entropy: Apparently so. 

Striggs: If you know some more efficient way of dealing with void shades, would you mind sharing it with us? It could help the people of this land a whole lot. 

Starling: I just wish we got to go back to our kingdom and took our revenge on those who we had to desert from. I can feel them tugging on the chains on my neck in my nightmares. And the dying screams of those we left behind… 

Striggs: Yea… 

Entropy: Why not just do it? 

Starling: What do you mean?

Entropy: 

Why are you kicking us while we're down?

Entropy: I am not. Look at the two of us alone. You two are stronger than me, plus a young void shade, plus a final category brighteye. We are more than strong enough to usurp a throne in this backwards-primitive sticks-and-stones pathetic land. 

Starling: No way. There's only, what, 10 of us at most. How is that enough to barge into the Honeycomb Castle and just kill anyone who stands on our way? 

Entropy: We only need four. You know how powerful a final category brighteye is. Or a void shade, even a young one. You saw each of us in combat on our own. The question is, are you ready to see all 4 of us in action? 

\*starling and striggs look at eachother, both nod\*

Entropy: And the best part. We could use that to also help this land and its undead problem. Having a puppet kingdom under our control could allow us to revolutionize anti-undead countermeasures lightning-fast with no bureaucracy standing in our way. 

Striggs: Yes! That's awesome!

Starling: Well, alright. I am down. Let's do this! Do we need any training, or equipment, or?

Entropy: We'll get some on the way. The only thing we need right now is a name for our new shade laundry squad. 

Striggs: We're already called Soaring Shrikes, why wouldn't that work? 

Entropy: It would! Soaring Shrikes it is then! Sorry about those we killed. We’ll make sure to repay our debts. 

Starling: It hurts to see the Shrikes recede in numbers every time, but at the end of the day, it's an occupational hazard. The most important part is that the Queen is getting her long overdue revenge! (At least, I hope it's as simple as this…)

*Before leaving, Entropy and Evan went to a granary to grab some food for the road*

Lady at the counter: Welcome, what can I get you? (You're not pirates, are you?)
Entropy: We need a large sack of wheat, barley, oats each on hand, one more with whatever dried fruit and nuts. Hurry up. 
The lady: Okay, I'll just need the letter from the royal office to confirm your identities. 
Entropy: *climbs over the counter and grabs the lady by the arm* Are you trying to annoy me? We told you it's urgent. In the name of the King, move. 
The lady: Guards! Help! We're being robbed by pirates! 
*2 guards come out with weapons drawn, then they proceed to put them away.*
Entropy: *ungrabs her to do a shrug* Oh no, it seems like we have been caught. Let us see what the guard thinks. *sarcastic, speaking with artificial sarcastic pauses between words*
Shrike Guard: These are not pirates. These are the King's trusted enforcers. 
Shrike Guard 2: You better do what they want. You don't want to stand in their way. 
Entropy: *bends over and looks the lady in the eye* Still willing to inconvenience me? 
The lady: No, no, that won't be necessary. Please don't tell the Count. *runs off screen*
Entropy: *shows guards "you did good" sign*








School idk what that is joke

\*arry finds a dead bandit\*

Kick him around 

Leads to options to further jeer at him or apologize

1

Bury him properly and replant a flower over the grave

Leads to options to further replant a flower over their corpse or resist

\*when you find Barry\*

\*Barry destroys a few bandits and gets a title card which says “He was in the process of killing someone when you met him so he must be cool”\*

B> Good afternoon, fine… someone. You have a pretty eyeglow. Never seen anything like it. 

A> My eyeglow? 

B> Yea. Never seen an eye of a brighteye shine pink. It's very pretty! 

A> Pink?... \*looks empty\*

B> ...Uh, saw you giving these scumbags a taste of steel in the distance. You're amazing at this! Pleasure to meet you. I am Barry, here to cleanse the forest of bandits, just like you, I presume. 

A> \*nods\*

B> What can I call you? 

\*Both counterparts try to answer different things and arry throws a tantrum\*

B> Okay… Can I at least ask if you're a man or a lady? I can't tell at a glance. 

\*Both counterparts try to answer different things and arry throws a tantrum\*

B> Is something wrong? Was it something I said? (I am guessing it's neither?) Are you okay? 

A> No… 

B> And yet you're still fighting like a cornered tiger? Wow… Can I call you <fusion of arry1 and arry2 names>? 

A> I don't know… Help… I feel a headache unlike any other… 

B> I don't know any healing. I don't even know what's happening to you. What do you feel? 

A> Bad… Like intrusive thoughts are overriding my decisions… Or am I the intrusive thought and I am talking over someone else? Why is it not happening now… 

\*an arrow flies from the bushes at barry, barry dodges it and cuts down the attacker very quickly and returns\*

B> It's not safe here. I don't know how I could help, but we can finish purging these bandits, return to Bluelight and find you some help from the clergy or the army. I get the feeling this isn't something a regular healer can help with. What do you say? \*Barry stretches out an arm and gives it to Arry\*

A> Yes. \*Arry is helped stand up\*

B> Alright! They stand no chance against us! 

\*Barry joined the party\*

\*barry and arry arrive near the bandit chief's giant tent\*

B> Hmm… Noone around. I'll check the tent. 

\*bandit leaders approach\*

OG(obsidian void golem with double daggers): ...prrresent Mother some prrremiere food, she'll underrrstand. She will be merrrciful if we trrry our best. 

BC(bandit chief): I hope you're right. \*pause\* Would you lookie here, we’ve found one of them. Here for the bounty on my head, “hero”? 

OG: You don't look like much. Wherrre is the second one, bounty hunterrr? The slick one that desecrrrates corrrpses? \*gleeful expression\*

\*Barry leaves the tent and sees the bandit chiefs\*

BC: There he is.

OG: This one doesn't have a face mask. The gearrr is colorrred differrrently too. Which means therrre arrre thrrree. Wherrre is the thirrrd one, herrroes? \*gleeful expression\*

B: Ignore him, he's trying to disorient you. So, Chief Blablabla? You don't look like much. 

BC: W-What? 

B: You don't look tough, that's all. Now, I-

BC: How dare you! Do you know how many potions of strength I've taken to achieve these muscles??? Would you believe it, Fireglass? 

BA: ... \*shrug\*

BC: You! We have the same Brighteye categories, yet you think you're so high and mighty and powerful for no good reason! We'll show you! Hrrrrr! 

\*if fireglass dies during the fight\*

FG: Tell Mother… I do not deserve mourning… 

\*during the fight you can taunt Blablabla to increase his attack speed but also decrease his defense\*

\*BA isn't meant to be killed here so he could reappear later but he could technically be knocked unconscious now though it's very hard because either high hp or some cheap tricks, and if that happens quron recruits him instead of someone else\*

\*if 

Post fight:

Option 1:

BC: Hrrrkh… So this is it… You were right about me after all… 

Option 1:

A: DIE FASTER ALREADY WE ARE IN A HURRY

BC: Heh heh… Spoken like a true cat 4 brighteye… 

Option 2: 

A: Sorry that we had to kill you, I am sure you would have made a wonderful friend. 

B: \*wtf face\*

BC: Ugh. Not even dead yet and someone is already pissing on my grave. 

End of crossroads

BC: When you proceed, tell her I did my best. Tell her, I am sorry. Don't feed me… To him… 

B: Hmm… Then it's true. It does go deeper than this encampment. I found some letters in his tent which suggest the same. 

A: \*stuck in inner thoughts\*

B: Come on, let's finish this. Arry? Are you alright? 

\*a choice to say yes or no but let's finish the job\*

B: Okay… Just hang in there, alright? (OR) Okay… Let's still get you examined after this is done. You know, I've been wondering from what walk of life have you reached this place. You're clearly experienced with fighting, and your spells are quite powerful

B: This is the Onyx Mountain, and from what I understand, there's a Great Void Shade hidden inside. These bandits were feeding it with bodies of brighteyes as a price for not being killed. I assume the golems of that Great Void Shade like the one we just fought were the ones doing the extortion, so they might be dangerous. I'll go forward to look for the hole in the mountain, loot anything you can find and meet me up ahead. 


\*unfinished\*

\*Barry and Arry meet Entropy and her hut in the caverns\*

B) Oh look, someone lives here! Someone human! Right in the caverns, somehow! 

E) \*sharpening katana, facing against the duo\* Mmm, visitors. Welcome, welcome. Got past Fireglass, didn't you? 

B) Yes, broke him into pieces. (OR) Yes, though he fled. 

E) Ain't that nice… Good for you. Have you seen the stalactites all around you? Also the stalagnates and stalagmites. They tell a story. A story that spans over centuries, perhaps millenia. Thousands of creatures go past these rock formations, not paying them much mind, yet the stone outlasts them all.

B) It's true! You know, I've been wondering how you were dealing with the hostile golems in these caverns. Do you-

E) It's a fascinating thing to uncover, really. They're good listeners, too. They never interrupt you, they never hate you for who you are, they never want to kill you, never want you gone out of their lives. They just stand, or hang, and do nothing over centuries. 

B) Okay…? (What is she on about?) 

E) In that sense, they're superior to all of us. Void shades, the red-eyed, the wild helium spirits… All of them are bothered with concepts like “sentience” or “life”, but these natural rock spikes or pillars? They're above such petty ideas. They're more than alive. 

B) ... \*confused face\*

E) Oh well. Wish you could tell me if the apotheosis is as beautiful as I imagine. Though, I suppose that's part of its beauty. \*stands up and draws katana\*

B) Wait. 

A: What. 






\*when barry and arry leave the cave and meet entropy again\*

E) So you've killed him. 

B) We did, yes!

E) That was my brother, you know. The little that was left of him. 

B) \*confused face\* What? 

E) \*crouches near a dead bandit leader\* The two of us destroyed entire armies attacking us. Three of us if we count this guy. (logic check if that's possible) We’ve survived for so long, and we… I was hoping we would keep surviving even longer. Seems like nothing lasts forever, not even the immortal. 

B) (Why does she seem inexplicably unbothered by anything that happened?...)

E) \*stands up, still facing opposite of the duo\* I suppose you intend to tie up the one loose end? 

Option 1: A) YOU WILL DIE. DIE DIE DIE DIE OXUXNDBRJXUDNSBRHX

E) \*smiles\* Aren't you a box of explosives…

\*Barry stops Arry\* B) Easy there, calm down! Sorry, we don't actually want to fight you. It's just that, they're… I don't know. They claim they constantly feel violated by something, and their state of mind seems very volatile. (rewrite to reference arry's previous observations when they're written) I am very sorry we killed your brother, but still, can you help? 

Option 2: A) Actually, why won't you join us so we can be best of friends together? 

E) I've seen baby rabbits with better acting. If you're gonna come up with excuses to rob me in my sleep or worse, at least present them with a believable tone. 

B) From the little I know about them, they might not be luring you anywhere. Arry sure is a bizzare human being. 

E) (That eye color is quite bizzare indeed…)

B) Look, we're sorry about your brother, but can you join us and help them with what troubles them, if you can? Sometimes they act very erratically, seemingly jump from one emotion to another, like they're being possessed. 

(End of crossroads) 

Entropy looks down sideways. E) Whatever. He barely had any sapience left anyway. You probably did him a favor by putting him out of his misery. 

B) (wtf face) 

E) I guess I don't have any other purpose in life anymore, so let's see what I can do. Come with me, there's a table nearby. 

B) Thank you? 

(scenery changes to the trio sitting in chairs plucked from bandits’ tables against eachother)

E) I don't think I've ever seen an eye of a brighteye which shines pink. It's not a natural color, the spectrum of natural brighteye colors only ranges from red to light blue, though I know several explanations behind how you could have gotten one. What's your story? 

A) (2 different forms of saying idk as an answer) 

E) But do you remember when you got it? 

A> (each counterpart of arry gives a different answer. Whichever one you pick, arry throws another self-contained confusion tantrum from the shock of being a fusion of 2 people)

E) Seems like that answers that. Your friend is a fusion of several beings, and \*not\* a willing one. 

B> (arry makes a shocked face) Fusion? As in, a fusion of two people through something helium-related? Isn't that good, actually, since the resulting person gets the strengths of both? 

E) The reality is a lot more nuanced. On paper, it's true, but being fused with someone without proper consent or even a warning or any preparation at all results in a mental shock beyond what any biological being is built to endure. 

A> I haven't ever heard of anything of the sort! 

E) So it would seem. 

B) I've never heard of this either. And knowledge about heliumology is quite common. 

E) Because it \*is\* extremely esoteric knowledge around these lands, even more so for how to perform it properly. The only thing I fail to understand is why would someone do that to you. 

A> Is there a way to reverse this? 

E) No idea. The culprit might know. 

Option 1)

A> WE MUST FIND THEM AND MAKE A SCLUPTURE WITH THEIR ENTRAILS

E) (smiles) As disturbing as this is, I must appreciate how straightforward you are with your desires. There's beauty in that. 

Option 2)

A> They must have had a reason to do this. What if us being in this state is critical for the world's salvation somehow? 

E) \*sideeye\* What the fuck is wrong with you. You are whitewashing an individual who subjected you to a fate worse than death. Why would anyone ever consider doing that? (Unless it's a defense mechanism?...)

B> I have to agree. But even if you don't think they deserve vengeance, we should at least find whoever did this to you and figure out why.

A> \*nods\* Yes. 

End of crossroads 

E) I assume you two are trying to start a proper maleficium laundry squad? 

B> The what now? 

E) Oh, right. It's called a Shadehunter Crew in these lands.

B> Yes, actually! I heard so much about the glory of the Crews, and I would love nothing more to form one!

A> It's not always a good time actually being in one, you know. Are you not from around here, Entropy? 

E) \*smiles\* There's a \*lot\* you don't know about me. 

B> So, does this mean you're in? 

E) For now, at least. 

\*Entropy has joined the crew for now at least\*

B> Yes! I've never been happier in my life! We're a real shadehunter crew now! 

E) Except our goal is closure/vengeance (depending on players previous choice) for and a reversal of a forced fusion, but I am sure you're aware laundry squads get way weirder than that.

A> That's true. 

(entropy packs her shit and the group is next seen in a carriage auto-driven by golem horses made out of stone, barry's real horse is also trotting nearby) 

A>...we remember attacking Steeltooth Castle ruled by a void shade tyrant with my comrades, Quron and Jerry. Both of us were there with Jerry. Quron stayed behind to provide us with cover. We won/lost (depending on what happened), but I… We can't remember what happened next. 

E) Sounds like we have 4 leads. Jerry, Quron, Steeltooth Castle and your former base. Good thing Bluelight City is only a few tens of minutes away. \*delay\* Wait, was it Quron or Jerry we're looking for in Bluelight City? 

(option to answer either at which point arry starts internally arguing again and starts another tantrum) 

B> I feel so bad for them…

E) It's a nasty sight, for sure. \*facing arry\* Try to decompress and not talk to anyone outside your body. You'll have a chance to rest properly at a local inn before we move forward with our goal. 

E: Coming up. Here, I have a few spare eyepatches. Put them on. 

B: Wait, why? Is that like a secret way to mark yourself as someone's allies? 

E: You seriously don't have any idea? Makes me wonder how you lived to see your, whatever your age is. 

B: 28.

E: Seriously? I am willing to bet a crate full of golemoids that's not true. 

B:... (Golemoids? Am I this devoid of knowledge?) 

E: Eh, keep your secrets. Point is, since the brighteyes serve for life, any that the guards see are either of the same or friendly kingdom, of an enemy kingdom, or are deserters.

B: Oh.

E: The eyepatches serve to cover the shining eyes, both to camouflage us as regular civilians and so we draw less attention from actual civilians, so unless you intend to massacre more guards than there are helium sprites in an elderly Black Hunger, you better get used to wearing those around any settlement of a non-trivial scale. 

Option 1)

A: YES TO THE MASSACRE

E: You sure, old timer? That kind of heat might interfere with the process of finding whoever is responsible for fusing you into existence. Not that I wouldn't appreciate the action. 

Option 1.1) 

A: KILLLLLLLLLLLL

E: There's definitely a light-blue brighteye in you, that's for sure. Trust me, I know how it feels to have society hate you for being born the wrong way, and that feeling of wanting to reclaim the mental high ground by ruining or ending a million lives as revenge for your own. Just remember that at the end of the day, no amount of blood washes away... you know, the reason you act that way. 

B: Wait, you're a light-blue brighteye? (Also, why are you enabling the angry half of Arry?...)

E: My brother was. 

B: Oh. 

Option 1.2)

A: \*start crying\*

E: … Should have seen this coming. It's best that you put on the eyepatch and we go the easy way. 

Option 2) 

A: \*put on the eyepatch\*

E: That's it. I am sure I haven't told you anything new just now. 

(End of crossroads) 

\*on the fly talk dialogue\*

B: So, how old are you, actually? 

E: Five. 

B: Well, at least the ballpark is at least someone close for what I claimed was my age. \*smiles\*

E: It's five hundred, actually. I am a daughter of a goddess, descended from the heavens to spread the knowledge of sarcasm to mere humans. 

B: (She makes me feel so stupid…) \*still smiles\*

Nice eyepatch. 

Nice eyepatch yourself.
