Project Starbloods

Timeline:
Early 2030's: extremely advanced gen AI swoops society, polluting the internet and letting democratic backsliding accelerate as a result. By this point, trump has plenary authority over US, and starmerite policy becomes standard, and Putin's russia is overthrown by an internal "democratic" coup. 
Mid 2042: israel and iran completely annihilate eachother in nuclear fire (to simplify).    
2050's: AGI boom happens (2048). Russia has been trying to get its hands on Europe for a while now with some success, but technological superiority lets them steamroll over their enemies. Russia is also renamed to Omnislavia (2050), and by the time the progress stops, they conquer pretty much the entire eastern and southern europe (minus turkey). Slightly before this point, EU is reorganized into European Federation (2046). Democratic backsliding at this point made functioning democracies nonexistent.  
2058: The Summer of Suffering happens where a billionaire creates an autonomous robot hive mind to cleanse North America of all human life. It works as planned and the entire NA becomes home to the Iron Fist, a nation exclusively populated by robots of various degree of sentience, with all human survivors fleeing to Eurasia. A global coalition to take back the continent is annihilated within minutes due to Iron Fist intel gathering being unreasonably good. Fear of AI slows down technological advancement to a more reasonable level. 
2070s: The Iron Fist force a treaty on humanity prohibiting development and use of nuclear weapons globally with severe consequences for violation after an artificial virus of plague inc tier strength (Corflaids) goes out of controlbut gets defeated  
2090's: present day of the books

The future russia is has been experimenting with human cloning and manufacturing secretly for a while, and after success, they create several prototype children with superpowers, with the main kid having telekinesis. He is grown in a lab environment and is provided with a mom and a dad who are secretly dead people resurrected as robots, and a class of other manufactured humans to provide him with a healthy social environment. Story starts with the main character being 7 years old, with him having ability to detect nearby people (not his parents).

It was March 13th, 2090. Another dead-silent night passed over an experimental, military-owned collective nurturing environment in the remote proximity of Tashkent, more commonly referred to as \*the lab\*. It consisted of many buildings, each serving as apartments for a single class of similarly-aged children and their assigned caretakers and jack-of-all-trades teacher. Each of them also included the classroom which also served as a detention room and a few other functions, the restrooms, the staff room, the everything - all packed into a single two-story building neatly. Each building, combined with the playground, the gym and everything else children needed outside after classes was referred to as a \*block\*, and each block was separated from others with roads, mimicking standard 4-lane roads from the cities in most aspects, except for being made out of painted concrete for durability and cost efficiency.

Hey, no snoring. Trying to establish the fucking setting here. Fine, here you go: the purpose of the lab was to nurture Starbloods into warriors, which were \*special\* bioengineered children who gained special powers throughout their life. The Starshards, which was what all children within the lab were formally and informally called, Starblood and otherwise, were also enabled and even pushed to fight eachother outside of classes, as long as they didn't kill anyone or cause any permanent damage, and blocks constantly went to wars against one another… What, am I going too fast now? Make up your mind already.

Fine, let's get to the point. This is the story about the most powerful Starblood in the lab, whose powers were absolutely devastating, who was feared by most and respected by the rest… Huh? Are you saying that's not a good setup for a shōnen-inspired story? I promise you, it's… You know what, fine. I'll give you a story about a Starblood with actual room for growth.

Adrian woke up in the morning, as he did every single day throughout his life. He didn't have much in life, but a tiny, yet fully functional room of his own was something he \*was\* entitled to, just like everyone in the lab. It had a bed, a table, a chair, shelves, a wardrobe and even a big window to allow the ruthless bright sun to wake him up early, since he couldn't afford the proper curtains. He was a white 10 year old boy of the most human-average face constitution, and his hair was black and medium-short. \*fix this description by writing it better, it sucks\* His arms were also quite muscular, which was unsurprisingly very common for Starshards, even for girls. He, along with many of his blockmates, learnt early on that being bruised by girls didn't hurt any less than being bruised by boys. By this point, it didn't hurt worse anymore, either.

Adrian put on his heat-protective cream, so as to not get fried by the scorching permasummer of the region of Uzbekistan, and dressed up in a standard dark-green t-shirt and brown shorts, fit for both classroom and the school breaks. The shorts had a modest sheath attached for his wooden sword: martial artists were rare in the lab, and he wasn't one of them. He brushed his teeth, rinsed his mouth, and went to the kitchen to eat with 3 of his brothers: Larry, Bill and Paul. Biologically speaking, they weren't brothers at all, and they didn't interact much with him. For example, now they were laughing and talking about beating the shit out of someone and something involving Johnsons (Adrian didn't know a single Johnson). Still, they shared the apartment and caretakers with Adrian, and so by the local definition of a sibling, they counted as brothers.

After finishing his sweetened but otherwise perfectly plain cereal along with green tea, he left his apartment along with his brothers to move out to the classroom and take a seat on the front rows. There were supplies and equipment for all kinds of lessons and general entertainment in drawers, some extra empty space, the smartboard behind the teacher's desk - everything needed to get such a multi-purpose room to work, and it mostly \*did\* work.

The rest of his block was slowly assembling too: Nathan, a Starblood in a red t-shirt and the block leader, his obnoxious girlfriend Lisa, the creepy blonde girl that nobody dared approach in a light-blue white-dotted dress covered to the brim with pockets, the guy who tried to fight with a sword in his mouth like in some Chinese cartoon called Haizei Wang and failed miserably, all other classmates whose names Adrian didn't care to remember… and some new boy with long, black hair, who looked way too tall to be in this block, who sat right behind him. His face also stood out by being much rougher than normal, and he was wearing a black t-shirt with a flak vest drawn on it.

"Who do you think you are to take my seat? Get your own!" - Adrian heard some girl from his block scold the new guy. "Hey, hey, hey, if you really want the seat, you could've asked!" - he heard her taking a few steps backwards. "Jeez. It's like you transferred here from Apathy Creek, Weirdo Street." - she said angrily before being heard walking away. Adrian didn't care to look backwards to see what was going on and kept balancing a pen on his right thumb to pass the time. Given that phones didn't let you do anything other than open the learning material during classes, he had to take what he could get.

After the first class finally started, the teacher, Mr. Mothersword, which was clearly not his actual second name, raised his hand to shut the class up and began:

"Morning, children. Before we begin, I wanted to introduce you to a new student transferring to this block. Bezdon, can you please step forward and introduce yourself?" - he was a man in his 50's with short hair, glasses, a jacket which made him look like a middle school student who was overprepared for middle school by his momma, and a stinky breath he was really insecure and self-conscious about.

Bezdon stepped forward in front of everyone's view, followed by insincere and even sarcastic claps. Everyone looked bored, except the new kid, who kept staring somewhere in Adrian's direction with a slight smile. "Yo." - he said in a somewhat deep voice in a carefree tone.

"That's it?" - an awkward silence dawned before being interrupted by whispers from the back of the bus after the teacher's question. Adrian heard stories on LabSocial about how awful other teachers were, and Mr. Mothersword wasn't nearly as unnecessarily strict, abrasive or power-drunk as some others. Not that he was perfect, or well-liked. "That's okay. Kids, this is one of the lab's most powerful Starbloods. He's on track to become one of the Motherland's best defenders. I want you all to show him due respect." - Mr. Mothersword reaffirmed what Adrian was already 99% sure of. Changing your name from the one assigned at birth required an entire thousand tokens, the local currency of Starshards, and earning and not losing a sum this huge in the lab wasn't something Adrian thought was even possible.

The rest of the class audibly expressed their confusion at what the teacher said. "What?/Huh?/Why?" - several people asked. "We already have too much Starbloods! Some blocks don't even have a single one. Why us? We don't want another one!" - Larry voiced what everyone else was thinking. "He's gonna bully us all into submission and ruin the streak! The streak, man!" - some other boy claimed for some reason.

The teacher raised his hand to shut everyone up again. "Now, now. Even though there were 3 Starbloods in this block before, one of you doesn't engage with the rest of the block, and one of you is, well, Adrian. So, we figured, why not put another, full-fledged Starblood into your ranks?" - he explained. He was right: of all the powers of ice, fire, hallucinogenesis and more, Adrian got the ability to detect nearby people in a pretty modest radius, and even then it didn't work on some people, mainly his parents. His step-parents told him that an emotionally rich, fulfilling or generally interesting life was essential for Starbloods discovering new abilities and ways to use them, but that didn't make any sense. Adrian may not have had any friends anymore, but he thought he lived a great life: playing really old games since the new ones weren't great, doing above average at school, going into battles and smacking his neighbors with a wooden sword, and it was clearly all interesting and fulfilling. Still, the disappointment at his own lack of growth loomed over him, and this was just another reminder that he could've been something greater.

The class still didn't accept the new arrival, but the teacher shut down their complaints as always and everyone went back to studying as usual. It wasn't that uncommon for the lab staff to force weird, stupid decisions like that, and it was a well-known phenomenon, according to LabSocial. Some assumed it to be social experiments, some thought it was a form of keeping the Starshards in line, but largely, nobody cared. That said, there was the term "Starspeck" formally designated for non-Starbloods, but using it around a Starshard was about as safe as eating a hornet's nest, even when used with no negative connotations, as the mechanics of "meaning over diction" or reclamation weren't known to 99% of the lab. The adults eventually had to stop using it, and it was a rare case where the Starshards' will could override that of their masters.

As Adrian was solving a long and stupid equation with an answer of 2 minus square root of 2, he felt something slithering around his left leg and then choking it. Upon looking down, grunting from the pressure, it was the doing of a smooth pitch black tentacle. "Why do \*I\* have to win the lottery again? There's 24 other perfect targets in the block. And it's during class, no less." - Adrian thought, taking a deep exasperated breath. Now he knew who the new arrival was exactly, and yep, he was indeed one of the strongest Starbloods. Possibly the strongest, since Adrian has never seen him lose any duels he was streamed partaking in. Starbloods didn't always have the flashiest possible powers, and they were sometimes manifested in unusual ways, like Bezdon's powerful dark tentacles. Adrian decided to sit back with his arms crossed and wait out the pain. The grasp kept gradually getting stronger before a second tentacle joined in, doubling the pain further. He laid on his arms, hyperventilating from overwhelming pain. \*make sure this doesn't sound sexual\*

"Is there a problem?" - the teacher looked at him and asked.

"He's hurting my leg and not-" - Adrian began answering in a severely strained voice before the tentacles let go of the legs and left him in peace. "-letting me concentrate." - he finished in his normal voice and gasped for air. "He stopped now." - he gasped for air again.

"He is clearly busy with his assignment. How could he possibly be hurting you?" - Adrian turned around to verify, and yep, he was indeed pretending to be busy writing something. Mr. Mothersword turned his head sideways somewhere. "I can hear you, Lisa. You're being loud." - he noted loudly.

"There were black tentacles grasping my legs. I can't focus when I'm in this much pain. Can I \*please\* get a different seat?" - Adrian asked, frustrated.

"Get back to work. You're not weaseling your way out of it." - he turned back towards the smartboard, where students were periodically called in to solve equations in order of when they were given in the digital textbooks, leaving Adrian's legs to be grabbed by Bezdon's tentacles not even a second after. It only took one \*honest\* mistake from 1.5 years ago, and from then on his worst intentions were always assumed and he could barely ever expect help from his teacher. "Victoria, could you explain what you're doing to the class, instead of just writing out the correct solution silently?" - Mr. Mothersword received no answer. "Hello? Like talking to a brick wall."

The tentacles continued harassing him throughout the class. Just when Adrian thought it was over, they began poking his legs instead. Sitting cross-legged on the chair without leaving the legs hanging made things even worse, as Bezdon just began poking his torso instead. Even though torsos were apparently more resilient than legs, the pain wasn't any less uncomfortable.

After the class was finally over, Adrian wasn't even done with a third of what he needed to do in class, meaning he had to do homework to make up for this. Homework in the lab was very scarce and situational, and having to do \*any at all\* always hurt. For school breaks, the children were always let outside and allowed to do whatever the 15 minutes they were given and the loose rules of the lab allowed. The surroundings of every block were outfitted with basic, difficult-to-damage gym and general practice equipment, magnetic lockers to store anything you needed, a playing field designed for various sports, the restroom, the sizable private room you could rent for tokens - everything needed to preoccupy the children on top of LabNet.

Instead of his usual exercise routine Adrian always did during the first break, he decided to go for a jog around the lab to give himself some rest from any potential bullying, which worked well for about 30 seconds before the numerous tentacles engulfed his body in full, lifted him up in the air and began choking him. Adrian was periodically given breathing windows, and he wasn't in danger of suffocating to death, but the windows were infrequent and insufficient, and the whole experience was still extremely painful.

"Please… Stop… Why…" - Adrian muttered. There was no response. "I have… tokens…" - the words fell on deaf ears. "Please… I

I'll take credit… If you stop…" - nothing happened, except for Adrian's energy being further exhausted by talking.

Over the course of the break, he heard noises of people gathering around the scene to observe and discuss the occurrence. Most were amused, the rest - shocked, not that Adrian could see anything other than the cloudy sky of his glorious homeland. Nobody tried to intervene - it wouldn't have ended well. When the loudspeakers invited the whole lab back to their classes, Adrian was quickly dropped face-upwards onto the ground from a small height, as if the last hour wasn't enough. He didn't have the energy to get up, but he could see Bezdon and his tentacles in full form for the first time as he was being rotated. He had 8 of them coming out from the top of his back, and as he was walking away along with everyone else, Adrian could see how they retracted back into his torso into 2 holes to the side of his spine. He had manually cut hatches for each tentacles' hole to streamline retracting into, similar to the flaps in assless chaps. The lower back had a highly detailed skull and bones symbol on them, taped in slightly off-center by accident.

Adrian hyperventilated for a while to collect the strength to get up and go to class, but his body refused to even roll around to the other side, let alone get up properly, and so he continued laying down, staring into the clouds and doing his best to not to cry as hard. To compensate for the volume of school being unintrusive, the consequences for trying to skip classes were the opposite, but at this point he was all out of gas. He was no stranger to bruises, knockouts, even beatdowns, which were even enjoyable sometimes, but this was way too much, and the worst part is, Adrian had no idea what did he do to deserve this. It looked like paid revenge, but what would that vengeance be for? When his blockmates asked him to help, he did so, little questions asked. He didn't beef with any other Starbloods. He contributed in battle plenty enough, and wasn't successful enough as a soldier that he gained any fame or infamy for it, either. The adults always made it clear \*they\* were responsible for punishing you and never used agent Starshards to enforce the order of the lab, with the word "order" being used loosely. So again, who?

After a few minutes, he saw his parents arrive

\*blah blah they give him some meds and get him back to class into a different seat, and they also fine him\*

The next class was about history. It was one of his least least favorite subjects (the double negative is intentional!), especially considering this particular lesson was about the Cold War, a fascinating 40-year period of the post-industrial era, and not "the history of how Ancient Egyptians invented clay". The entire world nearly being "fried by the cascade of gamma-rays" in the Cuban Missile Crisis was made even more fascinating to Adrian by the fact that neither Cuba nor America existed as countries in any form anymore, and that the USSR was ideologically reimagined twice since then.

He has successfully made it through the class without any other issues on top of being physically exhausted and mentally numbed and went outside. He knew what was happening earlier was only the beginning: he needed to endure more of that painful strangulation until Bezdon got bored, which could take anywhere from 10 more minutes to 10 more days, or could never even end at all. There was nothing left to do but to sit against a wall and mentally prepare for what's to come. Except when Adrian began approaching a spot where he wouldn't get scorched by the hellish Middle Asian sun, he heard Nathan tell Bezdon some distance away:

"Hey, new guy! You must think you're real tough." - he walked up in front of Bezdon and began staring at him. Despite being a functional Starblood, he still had a sheath with a wooden sword attached to his belt.

"Continue." - Bezdon grinned at him, not showing any signs of feeling threatened. Right after exiting the block building, he unsheathed his tentacles and began holding them to the side of his body like a pair of demonic wings, except the tentacles were pointing at Nathan. They made the size difference between the two feel even more exaggerated.

"What, you're new in the lab in general, or something? You don't see what I'm getting at?" - Nathan continued while a couple other blockmates of theirs noticed and started observing the exchange. Adrian also observed it, standing from a distance and covering his eyes with a hand.

"Pardon me, bro, I've got more brawn than brains, unfortunately. Could you spell it outloud for me, please?" - Bezdon requested in a carefree tone. He did his best to hide a smile.

"I am inviting you into a duel, for fuck's sake!"

"Oh, a duel, heard of those, sounds fun. Let's do this, noble Starblood. May our battle be legendary!" - everyone, not just Starbloods, loved to have cool speeches and stances to present to their opponents, but \*nobody\* made them this awkward and uninspired. It's like he actually was new in the lab: it was theoretically impossible to leave or enter the lab, but adults worked in truly mysterious ways, so who knows. "Need any prep time or wanna get to it?"

"I meant after school, with proper bets and audience and everything-"

"Are you scared of a little battle? Need half a day to prepare? Thought you were the proud block commander and not a cowardly wuss." - Bezdon taunted Nathan in a passive-aggressive tone.

"You're on, I'll make you eat those words!"

"That's the spirit! Come around the corner to the right so we don't get fried by the sun in 5 minutes and show me a good time." - Bezdon said gleefully and began walking away. He then coughed twice. "A good fight, I mean." - he said in a more neutral tone. As he walked by Adrian, he feinted a thrust at him from a different angle with each of the tentacles on his right side and walked away with a grin as Adrian stepped back and made a motion to block the would-be attacks with his right arm.

It seemed like there was a chance that Adrian wouldn't need to endure him any longer. Or that he'd get some breathing room for one school break. He relocated near a different wall to prepare to watch the fight when it finally happened and sat on the bench to watch the show. He knew the challenge wasn't about retribution or protection, since Adrian was mugged before by groups from other blocks and Nathan did nothing. It was more of a standard, melodramatic dick-measuring contest some Starbloods engaged in from time to time. They were fun to watch, and were one of the lab's favorite sources of entertainment, and this was one time Adrian got to visit one of those in person and not on a livestream.

After only around 3 minutes of sitting on a bench by the road and watching Bezdon stand on a white line of said road and browsing something in his phone, Nathan finally arrived at the scene, 1.5 adult alligators (5.25m) away from the opponent, plastic full helm on his head. Starblood or not, protecting your weak points wasn't something Starshards tended to ignore. By this point more than half the block had gathered around to watch, some with phones out to capture the footage, some to hang out on social media in general.

"I knew you didn't \*really\* need much time to prepare. A real Starblood could go to war anywhere, at any time, in underwear if they so please." - Bezdon spoke with the same glee as earlier, still doing something on his phone, or at least pretending. Starbloods weren't usually this calm about dueling, although the giant 4 pairs of tentacles to the sides of his body might have been a good justification for the exception.

"Shut up and put away the phone before I kick your ass." - Nathan assumed a combat stance with slightly bent knees and readied 2 small fireballs in each hand in front of his chest. It was customary for Starbloods to name their abilities, and Nathan's was named Scorching Infernal Fireball. 

Bezdon turned off his phone's screen and began rapidly, unevenly tapping against it with his thumbs. Yes, in that order. "Wait, hold up a second, need to finish something…"

After waiting for 15 seconds with an increasingly bored and frustrated face, Nathan finally couldn't wait any longer and threw the Scorching Infernal Fireballs he's been holding at the opponent in an arc, which expanded in radius by 2 times by this point, and Bezdon finally pretended to press the button to turn off the screen and put the phone away. At the same time, instead of dodging the fireballs or doing any other reasonable move, he poked each of them with one of his tentacles like balloons, reducing them into disproportionately small amounts of smoke, cinder and sparks flying sideways. These fireballs didn't look like much now, but they could inflict some pretty painful burns if they landed on someone's skin or clothes. 
Nathan began launching more of them with faster velocity, but they popped just like the rest. After watching everything with a blank expression for a bit, Bezdon rolled his eyes, made a performative yawn and pulled out his phone to pretend to type something again, which caused Nathan to hurl fireballs at higher fire rate. 
"Ah, thank god for my Inner Child. It's always everyone bothering me at the start of battles, why couldn't they just send me all these messages after them?" - Bezdon said with a smile ruining the line's initially apparent sincerity. And that's when Adrian recognized who Bezdon was: he shared a handle with the name of his Starblood power which he just dropped. Oh boy. 
The fireballs soon got way too small to pop, but Bezdon adapted by blocking them with the sides of his tentacles instead of popping them with the tips. At one point he even let one pass through to catch it with his left palm and licked off the cinder. Adrian couldn't tell if it hurt him at all.

Finally, realizing Bezdon was perfectly defended against the fireballs, Nathan pulled out his sword and charged at him in a well-practiced zigzag line. Bezdon pretended not to react, and when his opponent finally came close, he smacked Nathan with 2 of his right tentacles in the right shoulder, instantly knocking him to the ground to fall on his other shoulder. Some Starshards in the small crowd surrounding the battle cheered, mainly girls and troopers from the neighboring blocks. As he was recovering from the fall, Bezdon used all 8 of his tentacles to grab Nathan and lift him up in the air, leaving only the legs and head with the helm exposed, similar to how Adrian was grabbed earlier. Bezdon's slowly expanding shit-eating grin changed to a loud, maniacal cackle. "Oh, you really thought you had a chance! 'Ima eat those words', so how'd you like em? Did they pierce your soul with despair and hopelessness and fill you with rage at your own incompetence?" - he jeered euphorically, savouring the moment. 
"The Cube of Redundancy strikes again." - someone commented from the spectators, mocking the amazing super duper cool name of the power that Nathan was proud of and refused to ditch. 
"You know, you could've had a nice and peaceful day of punching pillows or dueling wet napkins, and I could've been minding \*my\* own business, but your foolhardiness was never gonna allow any of that!" - Bezdon cackled more and started walking around the scene aimlessly as everyone watched in silence.

"In retrospect, this couldn't have ended any other way. I guess I was hoping for a miracle..." - Adrian thought. This was also the first time he's seen a Starblood go through such extreme lengths to humiliate an opponent.

"Come on, keep trying to break free from the tenties. You can do it! I believe in you, man! \*Boy\*, I fought some pitifully weak Starbloods before, but ho-ho, you're actually pathetic. I knew you couldn't have been as good as a certain other Starblood in your block, but you haven't met even my lowest expectations! How did your block not overthrow you in all this time? There's some 8 year olds right down the road you can practice on, if-" - a girl from Adrian's block walked behind Bezdon and shot him in the back of the head from half an alligator (3.5m) away 3 times with a pneumatic pistol. She held it entirely in her right hand, since pneumatic pistols didn't have much in terms of recoil. Adrian didn't even know Starshards could get one of those.

Bezdon fell on the ground, his fall cushioned by the tentacles holding Nathan. Several people gasped and watched in shock. "Ah! Aaaaaaah-ow…" - he said as he fell on the ground. The tentacles retracted back into Bezdon's body on their own after another couple of seconds, and both duelists ended up lying on the ground, one grunting from pain, the other completely silent, lying face downwards. The girl then held the pistol upwards and blew off the smoke. There was no smoke.

"That escalated quickly." - Adrian commented outloud in moderate shock, even if his voice didn't reflect it. All of this was completely unprecedented.

She was wearing a white buttoned shirt with a faint light-blue grid and a reddish-brown rhombus-shaped cloth sewn to the top, visually resembling a small poncho, half-length jeans, a light-brown plastic helmet with a brim like on a cowboy hat and an open front despite the sides and back covered all the way down to the neck, and a determined frown. Her black hair was faintly visible above the forehead. The cloth went against the whole point of a buttoned shirt, but one button above the cloth remained so as to not kill the practicality with fashion completely. "Maybe \*you\* can practice on 8 year olds. With not being a sick, sadistic fuck! You come to a block of 10 year olds despite nearly being old enough to join the frontlines, abuse your powers, who the fuck do you think you are?" - she asked angrily. The "old enough to join the frontlines" was a hyperbole: Bezdon didn't look even remotely close to being 16.

"Kate, I think he's dead." - some other girl in the crowd said.

"What? Oh, fuck!" - Kate stepped back and covered her mouth with the left hand and lifted her right hand down. "Can someone check his heartbeat or something? In case he's playing dead." - she said quickly and anxiously.

Nobody moved or said anything until Nathan finally got up and joined the spectators. "Thanks." - he said as he walked away.

"Do me a favor and don't feel entitled to me saving your face next time." - Kate requested with mild disdain, fear or anxiety still seeping through her words, it wasn't clear what exactly. Might have been both.

People started slowly going back to their usual activities one by one. After another tense couple of seconds, she stepped forward to check on Bezdon at the same time as Adrian, pistol aimed at Bezdon. "I got this, I'm ready for the next round if it's coming." - he said.

"You're crazy. Stand aside, you've gone through enough today." - Kate reached Bezdon first, crouched and flipped him around, still aiming at him with the pistol, all the while Adrian was standing and watching it in suspense.

"I think that's pot to the kettle. Said pot to the- whatever, you get me." - he replied awkwardly, almost completely ruining any chances of his sentence being comprehensible. Some quiet conversation or conversations in the crowd were overheard.

As Kate checked Bezdon, his eyes were closed and he showed no emotion. She then put her left index finger near his nose, stood back up and made some distance again. "Thank fuck. He's just unconscious. Oh man." - she said with huge relief.

"Thanks for doing this. Why did you even shoot him? Now he's gonna be after you too." - Adrian asked. Cheating and intervention like that in Starblood duels was extremely rare, as the consequences were always cataclysmic for everyone involved.

"I can handle the consequences of my actions, don't you worry, uhh, what's your name?" - Kate said with determination as she put away her pistol into her right pocket.

"Adrian."

"Yea, Adrian, I am no Starblood, but I can stand up for myself better than you think."

"What she's trying to say is, she thinks that her ideological purity and a mini-crossbow that shoots rubber bolts make her a divine guardian angel." - the same spectator girl from earlier elaborated sarcastically.

"Jules, I'd slap you in the face right now if we weren't busy. Anyway, let's call the adults before the next class starts." - the playfulness of Kate's voice in that comment went completely over Adrian's head.

After the break was over and Bezdon was carried by adults to the room of the block's doctor, the next class started. It proceeded in peace as usual, with nobody bothering Adrian as he sketched a sloppy black-and-white drawing of a western gunslinger facing forward left and being in a standoff with a black void with tentacles and a single vertical eye in the middle. He then drew more tentacles, grasping the cowboy by his torso and legs, and made his visible eye fully black. Drawing was one of Adrian's main ways of dragging time during boring classes like literature, although the results didn't usually end up this cursed. Unfortunately, the teacher didn't allow him to do homework for other subjects during unrelated classes, which would've been really nice.

After the class was over, he heard Dr. Brone come over to Kate and ask her to come with him along with Mr. Mothersword. Adrian, along with a few other children including Nathan, followed into his office even though none of them were invited. It was a huge white, sterile room split into 2 parts, the office with a desk and shelves filled with various supplies, mainly for treating bruises and other minor combat injuries, and a room with 4 hospital beds for Starshards who \*really\* got into trouble. It saw plenty of use due to the nature of the lab, and it was common sense to stay in the doctor's good graces. In the second sub-room, one of the beds was occupied by unconscious Bezdon. Upon their arrival, their teacher began:

"What happened? Why didn't he come back to class?" - he sounded more frustrated than worried.

"I am afraid he won't be back for a while. Along with both of us and the entire block, I reckon, after the guys upstairs are done with us. He's comatose." - the doctor explained, sounding like he was going through the second stage of grief. The 2 nurses which assisted him were nowhere to be found.

"What?" - Kate asked loudly with shock, covering her mouth. Without the helmet, her medium-length black hair with a ponytail behind the head was visible: another reminder in Adrian's life to not judge a book by its cover. Everyone else was also shocked from the revalation.

"It's unlikely to be anything else. Even adults aren't made to sustain that much blunt trauma in that part of the head, let alone a child."

"You've done fucked up, sis, I'm afraid. I really hope you don't go into the slammer.." - some other girl in the group said.

"Language. Kate, I sure hope you have an explanation for putting one of the lab's most successful Starbloods into a coma. Maybe then when the military whoops our buttocks, they'll go \*slightly\* easier on us." - Mr. Mothersword said stressfully.

"I didn't mean to put him into a coma, he'll hold a grudge on me for the rest of my life! I'm not stupid, I meant to just knock him out and use my ways of dealing with shitheads to stop fucking with our block." - Kate's tone shifted from shocked and defensive to just tense and offensive. "Speaking of, here's a reason number 2, he was an asshole. And he was also not wearing a helmet like normal people do in battle."

A few other Starshards nodded. "Not wrong." - Nathan approved. In a different context, that point would have been considered victim blaming, but different contexts also don't have children becoming victims to physical trauma for dinner.

"For everyone's sake, I sure fucking hope our bosses will see it that way too." - Dr. Brone reassured.

"Vlad, watch it." - Mr. Mothersword said in a neutral tone.

"Oh, get off your high horse, Lexy. These aren't your standard kids, you saw how many bone fractures were recorded in the last year alone. What, you think they're like 19th century aristocrats at a ball when we're not looking?" - the block's doctor was sometimes an impatient, brash and brutally honest person. Still, he stood up for the children he helped, occasionally gave useful biology-adjacent defensive advice and never treated anyone with injustice, and for that nobody among his common visitors hated him.

Bezdon was carried out of the block somewhere during the next lesson, and the rest of the day passed without issue. Every single weekday consisted of 5 lessons for Adrian's block, plus an extra one for those who didn't abhor school or wanted to earn some extra tokens. In turn for a small amount of classes and little to no homework, Starshards had no summer vacations or holidays apart from public ones everyone celebrated. Older blocks got slightly more classes, younger ones got slightly less, but the system was pretty consistent across the entire lab. It was meant to fully provide the Stardshards with necessary education while still allowing them plenty of mental energy for brutally swinging wooden swords at one another, and while there were plenty of dysfunctional aspects about the lab, this wasn't one of them. That said, the children weren't allowed to stay in their apartments until 18:00 except for food time, regardless of the day of the week. It was fine to go in and get something, but not to stay. It was still a very intrusive way to force Starshards out of gaming their free time away like normal kids did, but everyone mostly accepted it as a necessary sacrifice by now.

On the first school break of following day, Adrian wanted to approach Kate and ask if there were any news, but she was too busy playing competitive card games against her friends, holding a black +4, yellow 6, blue 5, 2 red 3's and another black +4 in her hand, the hidden part facing the table. It would have been too awkward to approach them, so Adrian didn't. The next break, however, when he went back to his daily routine of looking for early 21st century mobile games to play on a bench in the shadows (because the recent ones felt even more soulless), Kate approached him herself and sat down to the left of him. "Hey. How ya feeling after yesterday?" - she didn't have her helmet hat on. Most Starshards only put on helmets before combat due to them generally being uncomfortable, with only occasional exceptions.

Adrian looked at her with surprise. "Oh, hi. I'm fine. It wasn't \*that\* bad." - he then looked back at his phone, even though he stopped actually touching the screen to focus on the conversation.

"I'm not here to jeer at you or exploit your vulnerabilities, it's okay! Come on, be honest with yourself at least. I don't bite." - Kate gave Adrian's shoulder a not-so-gentle push with her fist.

"Well, my pride \*was\* hurt. I didn't think it could be hurt further, but here I am."

"There you go. See, nothing bad happened!" - Kate noted. Not only was she wrong in her read on Adrian, but he also intentionally omitted to still being a little sore.

Adrian put his phone into sleep mode, put it away and laid back and looked further away. "I actually wanted to ask earlier today, what's the news about Bezdon? And jail and stuff?"

"He should be fine after a while. I also asked my dad if I'll be going in the pen, and the adults apparently liked my reasoning in the reports, so no slammer for me, so we had nothing to worry about." - Kate began spinning a large green triangle ruler around her left index finger. "Why are you looking in the other direction? Embarrassed of a girl saving you from trouble?" - she asked with playfulness.

"No, no, I just…" - he turned around to look Kate in the eyes, then switched to looking at nothing only a few seconds later because it was horribly awkward.

Kate chuckled and gave Adrian's shoulder another fist push. "What, scared of girls in general and worried I'd eat your heart?" - she switched tone to a more calm and neutral one abruptly. "You can look wherever you want. I am not demanding you to stare me in the eye."

Adrian nodded gratefully and began staring at empty benches against the wall of the opposite block instead. "It's not just girls, it's because whenever someone approaches me, they always want something from me and don't ask me how I feel or anything." - he explained with mild tension in his voice, and no, it was partially girls.

"Oh, is that an introvert thing? Yea, people can be really selfish and apathetic assholes sometimes. At least \*you\* don't seem like one."

"Thanks?" - Adrian wasn't sure a thanks was appropriate here. "Anyway, what's the deal with the eating my heart, is that a metaphor for something?" - he was still a bit stressed by the unfamiliarity of his circumstances.

"I don't know. Just trying to guess what you boys think of us. Badly, apparently." - Kate chuckled and slapped her right hand on Adrian's shoulder.

"Doubt I could give you any hints on that one. Mainly because I also don't know what boys think of you." - Adrian smiled, ignoring the pain of the slap. "All I know is, you guys participate in battles less often, you tend to have different personalities and behaviors and that's the end of my girlopedia."

"Girlopedia, excellent word choice." - Kate's thought to comment on the accuracy of his observations was lost in the conversation.

"What is it with the pushing, by the way? Is it girlish code for something?" - Adrian started alternating between looking at Kate and at the block opposite of them, looking at each for 10-20 seconds.

"I don't know, man, just thought it was boyish code for affection." - Kate switched to a macho voice, frowned in a masculine way and made a gesture of riding a motorcycle with her arms. "Tough love, brother." - she then broke into laughter, which immediately spread onto Adrian in lower potency. \*verify language\* "Did I guess it right or am I doing a misandrist equivalent of the watermelon thing?" - she asked in a joyful but otherwise normal tone. "The watermelon thing" was meant to reference the notorious "black people go crazy for watermelons" stereotype taught by adults to explain mechanics of prejudice.

"I don't know, man. I almost know less than you. I don't even know who's Miss Andrei." - he answered in a moderately joyful accent, entertained by the conversation. Kate laughed for a little while. "I don't know if you know, but I am pretty much a generic goon. I've never met a Starblood more useless than me. You're the opposite, you're not even Starblood, yet you have the kind of control over your life I could only dream of, and you're great to talk to."

"Thanks! Still, if I could become something in life, so can you. It's not easy, but not much in life is." - Kate put her right hand on Adrian's shoulder, gently this time. "How do you feel about spending some time with a heart eater? My homie squadron has had a stick up their asses lately."

"Hell yea, let's do it! Don't remember last time I got \*that\* offer. What's up with the homies?"

"I don't know, actually. Maybe it's nothing. Just needed an excuse for a change of scenery."

After the loudspeakers invited everyone back inside for classes again, Adrian asked Kate as they walked there together:

"You know, do you know why did Bezdon target me the way he did, without saying a word?"

"Because he's a sadistic shitface, what else? People like that just exist, our environment reinforces this mindset and lets them thrive." - Kate explained.

"It's still weird. Do you think he has any friends which could avenge him?"

"I've got a few friends who can avenge his vengeance too. The one on my belt and the one beside me." - she said proudly and poked Adrian's arm. The first "friend" she referred to was her pistol, in case the shock from this insane setting hasn't settled in for you yet.

Nobody ever came to avenge Bezdon.

S1E2 Dark Snark Redemption (move Making Compromises We All Have To as a name for a latter chapter)
*this chapter has repertetive descriptions, fix it later*
"war hero, a mass murderer, or possibly both"

Adrian and Kate were sitting on a bench. "But the Starshards who visited the big house before, I collected what they said on LabSocial about their experience. They all said there was fuck all to do, the adults treated them rough and fed them slop, the beds were shit. And when looking at the full picture, you just have to ask the question, why? I don't like using the term 'child abuse', as that term implies that what we're all doing in the lab with our cool battles and duels is somehow bad, but I just don't know how else to call the conditions they have there. You can't call it any differently than child abuse." - she explained, moving her hands all over the place. LabSocial was where the Starshards could talk, share worthless selfies made in stupid places and stupid videos, some of which even had entertainment value. It adopted its name from OmTube, which was previously called Rutube, which adopted its name from Youtube, which probably adopted its name from old cartoons about soap opera of sentient soap, and despite that, it borrowed features from many different social media platforms, not just Omtube. It was the only social media the lab ever needed, and it worked well enough.

"I got some of that. I think. The prison conditions are abusive and unfit for children, is that what you're saying?" - Adrian asked, using all he had to try to understand whatever shitfuckery Kate was preaching about to him.

"Yes!"

"I don't really know why do you say it's child abuse, though, since from what I gathered that just sounds like prison conditions for any adult jail. Doesn't that mean it's \*just\* abuse?"

"What? No. That's not what- Actually, what am I saying, I never liked the term "child abuse" anyway. Yes! You're not wrong. There's nothing for me to add." - to clarify, please don't conflate what these characters say with what I actually hold as an opinion. Even if that character receives depth and love.

Some new kid in a white t-shirt and a very out of place white bandit mask approached Kate and Adrian and started standing next to them. "Morning, lady and gentlesir! How are you doing this fine morning?"

Adrian began feeling something completely foreign to him. Like something was wrong. "Oh, look, it's the other new transfer!" - Kate exclaimed, then covered the side of her mouth and said quietly, "Wait till he hears how I deal with newcomers to our block", before she faced the new guy again. "I'm just kidding. I would never shoot you in the head. I don't think you'll give me a reason to. Listen, big talk, new guy, what do you think about the mistreatment of Starshards in the lab's prisons and my planned proposal to the adults to remedy it by granting lab's prisoners a right to get better treatment?"

"It's bad? I don't know, what do you think-" - the boy asked Kate. Adrian just stared at them without saying anything.

"So you don't think my manifest deserves to be sent to the adults? Well, let me tell you some more counterpoints: I have unconfirmed reports that the adults torture prisoner Starshards in there. I also remember several people consistently mentioning horrible beds, horrible food, excessive physical force, and worst of all, there was no entertainment. Nothing to do. Tell me, is this seriously what you're gonna allow to happen in our god-blessed lab?"

"...My name is Stefan." - the kid waved awkwardly.

"I can understand if my line of questions might be a little too upsetting for you, or that you may not believe me, but I have my sources. Look, I am gonna look up the folder with this evidence and show everything to you, it's all true, it's all real, hold on a moment…" - Stefan walked backwards, staring at Kate, and left as she was explaining. She then looked in his direction and saw him walking away. "You cannot close your ears to block out the truth! The good always triumphs over evil!" - she yelled in his direction.

"I don't think he ever said anything about the manifest being bad. I don't think he understood anything you were talking about." - Adrian observed.

"Really?" - Kate broke into laughter. "I must have sounded like such a dork! No wonder I am falling out of touch with my sisters."
"I am all too familiar with such failures. Hell, I live them. Ever wonder why I haven't had any friends in a while? That's why, because I am cringe when others are around."
"Oh, that's true. I like that. That's a good way to spin it." - Kate pointed a finger gun at Adrian.
"What do you mean?"
"We're both cringe! And we both scare others away! That's why we're perfect together! Because from a perspective of a lab's dreg, another dreg isn't so bad."
"I wouldn't call you a dreg... But... To being cringe!" - Adrian got peer pressured to reconsider, and he stretched out an arm towards Kate, holding an invisible alcohol glass. Though, "peer pressure" might have been an hyperbole. 
"To being cringe, bitches!“ - she did the same. 

Meanwhile, a different kid kept being cringe too. As a couple of boys were playing competetive ping-pong, Stefan approached one of the players. 4 spectators watched him with confusion. "Good morning, ye lads! How are thee fine gentlemen behaving yourselves?" - he asked *name of the not guilty culprit from way later in the book*, one of the participants. He used an accent he saw others use in films, thinking it would be charming to have as a schtick.
"Good." -  *name* replied quietly, trying not to lose focus.
"You make a weird expression on your face before you pong a ball. Do you have a medical disease?"
"Can you stop bothering the contestants, you fucking toilet?" - someone from the spectators requested angrily.
"I just wanted to make sure everything is alright. *name but distorted* clearly looks like he is good at the game, but maybe if he got the disease illness cured he would be even better." - Stefan said, genuinely hoping his insight would help. Mid-sentence, *name* missed the ball as Stefan was standing on the way of the ball's trajectory, causing the ball to bounce off Stefan's nose and fall to the ground.
"6-7." - someone among the spectators said bluntly. *name* took no time to pause before swinging the ping-pong paddle right in Stefan's face.
"Whoa, whoa, hey, what's, why..." - Stefan said, trying to block the attacks with his arms. *name* put away the paddle, pulled out a wooden sword instead and started swinging that at Stefan instead, shouting random curses in a fit of rage. 
"Yes! Teach him how to manipulate the score!" - *name*'s opponent reinforced. "Smash his face! Smash his face! Smash his face!" - he also started chanting before it spread to all but one spectators. The remaining one still made mouth movements to pretend he was saying it too. 
Stefan tried to start running away, saying "I'm sorry! I don't know what I did wrong!" through the sobbing, but *name* caught up to him, grabbed him by the back of his shirt and plunged him into the ground. He then proceeded to curb stomp Stefan for a solid 25 more seconds, all the while the rest continued chanting in support, beside that one standout spectator who really wanted to say the boy got the message several times over, but knew that would have been self-destructive. A few more Starshards also joined the chanting during that half-minute, even though none of them had any idea what was going on. 
Eventually, when *name* finally got it out of the system, he entered a state of catharsis and said, "Phew... Learnt your lesson yet?" 
"Yes..." - Stefan finally said, and everyone turned around and started walking back to the ping-pong table. "You have medical trauma... From parents..." - he also added, causing everyone to slowly turn back around to stare at him. "You have bottled up rage... I don't hold this against you... You just need a friend..."
"Please, read the room, my man! What the fuck are you doing? How isn't this obvious?" - that one spectator who wanted to defend him earlier asked with mild frustration.
"It is... *name but distorted* just needs some help..."
I'll leave the ending up to your imagination. Stefan did not give himself time to recover from the numerous bruises and lacerations, as he was determined to make at least some friends this day, and this continued for several more cycles with different groups of people.
//Stefan went to ask Kate's friends about what's the secret to beating the final boss of Patriot Pony XXVII, went to give a recluse girl in light-blue white-dotted dress uninvited (and honestly straight up bad) advice on how to make friends, then interrupted another group of block's Starshards during a couple of concurrent sparring matches to show off his breakdancing skills.// (if editors decide i shouldn't skip these descriptions) 
Not all in a row, only once or twice a school break.
By the time school ended for the day, the word of his unintentional chaos spread across the block. However, Stefan didn't think he was screwing up that bad, and eventually he went ahead to try again by approaching Nathan and a group of Starshards exercising.
"Just a few more pullups, Billy! Think of the streak! Think of how we will triumph in our next battle! Think of how awesome block 85 is!" - Nathan was encouraging one of Adrian's brothers. Funnily enough, the latest sentence had the opposite effect, though Nathan didn't notice.
"Hey, guys! What are we doing?" - Stefan approached the group and asked. 
"Not him again." - a Starshard girl said.
"What's up with your arm? I've never seen a skin tear this massive." - Nathan asked with genuine concern.
"Oh, it's nothing." - by this point, Stefan's clean appearance was completely ruined by the beatings he received. He was a little limpy, but he was determined to have at least one win for the day.
"We're practicing for an upcoming battle, so we don't ruin the win streak. Here to join?"
"Sure, sounds fun! Who are we fighting against? What's the ace up our sleeve, or our secret tricks that would make us continue the streak?" - Stefan asked, approaching the dip handles. He tried to pullup, but he was obviously not in the right shape for it.
"Oh my god, boss, why are we interacting with this guy still? He'll just be a nuisance." - Bill said.
"I won't be, trust me! I am changing my ways. From now on, I will be a proud soldier of block 85! I will destroy our enemies with my sword swings! Just tell me what to do and I'll do it!" - Stefan said, making an Omnislavian military salute of putting a fist against his right temple.
Nathan squinted his eyes and thought for a moment. "Yea, I see what you mean, Billy." - he said before getting behind Stefan. "Hands behind your back." - Stefan didn't resist Nathan handcuffing him with plastic handcuffs.
"Wait, what's going on? Are you leading me to an initiation ritual? Oh, thank you, Starblood boss! I will not disappoint you!" - Stefan exclaimed. It was audible how he was pushing his physical limits to maintain this front.
"Has anyone got duct tape?" - Nathan asked before realizing he had some in his pocket too. "Oh, is it gonna involve duct tape? That's awesome, I love-" - Stefan was interrupted by Nathan duct taping his mouth.
A small crowd of Starshards observed everything. "Oh, drop the act, you little spy. We know why you're really here. This is nothing unusual for block 81. They pulled this kind of shit before." - *name* said. 
Stefan just looked at him confused and said, "Uhhhhh! Uh-uh." - and then murmured something more, though it was unintelligible through the duct tape. 
Nathan started leading Stefan further on somewhere. "We had a protocol ready for weeks in case one of the enemy blocks sent a spy to infiltrate and sabotage our ranks. Come on, infiltrator, don't force me to hit you to make you move faster. Have your blockmate intelligence operatives told you what we've decided upon yet?" - he asked Stefan, smiling.
"Uh-uh." - Stefan replied.
"Well, you're about to find out! We're nearly there." - one of the boys from the crowd commented.
"This is gonna be good. They'll be scared shitless of ever messing with block 85!" - Larry said gleefully. 
Others made other supportive comments, too.
"By the way, just to clarify, I am not sorry for beating the shit out of you. Hell, I'd love to get a few more swings, if Nate lets me!" - *name* said, for example.
"Hold it together, *name*. We'll get to the fun part very soon." - Nate reassured him.
It wasn't long before him and Stefan reached a tall pole in the ground. Nate and a few others then tied Stefan up to it and doused him in sawdust, then put a few thin pieces of wood near the bottom of his legs.
"For spying on the glorious block 85..." - Nathan started saying proudly before getting interrupted.
"And being an annoying piece of shit!" "And for bothering me!" - a few others from the assembled crowd added.
"Shut up! I'm talking! For being a spy, an annoying piece of shit, for disrupting the block, the supreme court of justice and investigation of block 85 unilaterally sentences you to... Being burnt alive!" - Nathan finished with a grandiose tone, followed by cheers from the mob of Starshards. It took Stefan until now to realize the seriousness of the situation he was in, and he quickly descended into panic, though being tied down top to bottom only gave so much visibility to his panic. He understood even less about what he did wrong compared to previous"But first... Raise your hand if you want to use the spy as a training dummy a little before sending him to Hell to hang out with communists, protesters and furries." - 6 Starshards raised their hands. "Okay, each of you gets 20 swings, then we let the execution by lethal injection of fire commense."
*name* went first. As he was on his 5th swing, Nate remarked, "How do you like the way block 85 handles justice? We will never let foreign spies sabotage our unity. Your death will serve as an ample discouragement from anyone screwing with us ever again!", but Stefan was in too much pain and stress to react.
When he was receiving his 53rd strike, Kate broke through the crowd, which by this point bloated to around 35 Starshards, more than what block 85 even had. "Hold your fucking horses, boys, what do you think you're doing? Why am I hearing rumors that you're gonna burn the new kid alive?" - she asked loudly, interrupting the one currently swinging at Stefan. Adrian just joined the crowd to observe everything. 
"Oh, it's the fun police again. Look, guys, it's Karen, the girl who's gonna cost us the streak! Let's applaud her for her effort to derail her block from glory!" - Nathan started clapping, and way more people than he expected echoed it. Most of them weren't from block 85, though. The actual sister of Kate named Karen took a deep breath and left the crowd in sadness. 
Kate flipped the crowd two birds. "Your sarcastic claps can only mean I am doing something right! I am proud to be hated by you psychopaths!" - she shouted.
"Why are you here, agent from block 83?" - Nate asked mockingly.
"Because you're burning a guy alive? Dude, that's a Starshard. An Omnislavian. This isn't a game. Why do you think you can get away with murder of a fellow citizen?" - Kate put down her arms, and put one hand slightly above her pistol, ready to draw at any moment.
"It was never a game. Do you even know what he did?"
"Well, enlighten me, what crime does carry the death penalty in the glorious block 85?"
"He was annoying, you farty chicken! And he is a spy!" - Bill answered. 
"By whose fucking decision? This is obviously a lynching." - unfortunately for Kate, few knew what lynching stood for, fewer still felt like she had a point. 
"The Supreme Justice Command of block 85 has spoken. It has decided to sentence him to death, as per protocol we developed prior!" - Nathan pointed out. He also literally pointed out a thumb at Kate. Several Starshards in the crowd said "Yea!".
"You mean you decided it yourself and everyone followed without even so much as examination of evidence and an appropriate level of punishment? Unless you mean to say there was a trial prior to the sentencing where all of this was handled?"
"A trial, good idea! That way we can properly ensure without a doubt that the execution shall be fair!" - Nathan agreed.
It took a short while to actually assemble a court along with all the chairs required for everyone to sit in. Nathan took the role of the judge, despite Kate's objections, all the victims and eyewitnesses took their positions, Kate volunteered to be the advocate, and everyone else just continued observing everything from the side. She tried to get Stefan untied or at least ungagged, but Nathan wouldn't have that either. It probably wouldn't have made a difference, as Stefan was long knocked out by the pain shock. 
"How does it feel to fit the definition of the devil's advocate, Kate?" - a sister of Kate asked her mockingly.
"Tina, if this is enough of a cause for you to talk to me that way, then I guess our friendship was never real in the first place, was it?" - Kate answered calmly. 
"Oh, no, that's not what I meant! I'm sorry." - Tina apologized, her bluff exposed. 
Another while was spent as the victims recited their experience, very often hyperbolizing how bad Stefan actually was.
"...and then he finally ran away." - *name* finished.
"So the dude annoyed a bunch of people, admittedly a huge bunch, and disturbed a tournament. And you want to burn him alive for it? Seriously?" - Kate asked.
"And don't forget that he is obviously a spy! He approached us and started asking us combat related questions, was suspiciously cheerful about supporting us. He obviously wanted to relay info about our block to our enemies!" - Nathan argued with Stefan tied to a pole right behind him. 
"Source: your ass, right? Do you have incriminating message screenshots or notes, or literally anything at all?" - Kate asked with mild anger.
"His behavior was extremely suspicious! You would have agreed if you saw it. I've seen it, Bill has seen it, Trish has seen it. We recited you what he said already!" 
"So, you're using obedience to the dear leader as evidence for his insincerity? Does that mean Bill and Trisha are also spies and deserve execution?" - don't be under the illusion that Kate was literally the only one against execution at this point. There were a couple Starshards from the crowd who felt like she had a point, notably Adrian, and a few among victims who even spoke out in support, notably Tina and Julia. The execution faction was still dominant. 
//"What are you even doing, Kate? What do you plan to gain from this arguing? Do you want to see us falsely execute more of our blockmates and leave the actually guilty, actually unloyal one alive?" - Bill asked Kate. He was genuinely puzzled by her position.
"I plan to gain justice!" - Kate made a fist. "Haven't you remarked yourself that he doesn't learn anything? Have you ever wondered w-why? He doesn't know how to talk to people and he's constantly failing because of it! // *in case this is actually fine*
"Trisha and Bill have near perfect grades in school and their opinion matters a lot more than yours! When was the last time *you* sparred with us?" - *name* argued, though I am using the word loosely.
"I can also use irrelevant metrics to declare y-you-you all as worthless and me as the smartest person in the room. How many perfect ellipses can *you* draw in a row?" - Kate was starting to get a bit tired. 
"I've heard enough! The court has spoken. What part of 'we're executing a guy for being extremely annoying and a spy' don't you understand, Kate? How dumb are you? I find Stefan of block 81 guilty!" - Nathan smacked two of his swords against eachother. That's the best alternative for a gavel he could come up with. A question of why the court was called in the first place perplexed Adrian.
That one girl with light-blue, white-dotted dress walked into the "courtroom" from the crowd, and all spectators momentarily stopped talking as loudly. "If I may, there is a third option beyond letting the obviously guilty defendant go and execution of a Starshard. There are ways to make any person change their mind on anything through professionally applied force. Transfer me 35 tokens and I will make sure he never bothers you again and that he never transmits the received intelligence to his home block. It will only take a few minutes once he regains consciousness." - she said with coldness in her voice, throwing a crystal ball in her hand up and down. 
"For once, she-she-she has a point! At least do that! It's still better than murder!" - Kate agreed, desperate for any solution at all. 
"I am not paying a single token!" - Trisha said from the chairs of eyewitnesses and victims.
"Me too!/Me neither!Yea!/Burn them all alive!" - others agreed.
"The grand jury has spoken. Your services will not be necessary! Let the burning commence!" - Nathan exclaimed, raising his wooden swords and hitting them against eachother loudly. 
The girl in a blue dress shrugged, turned around and left the scene completely. "Your loss." - she remarked. 
"Wait, should I bring some oil to make him burn brighter?" - someone from the witnesses asked.
"Good idea!" - Nathan agreed. "I'll guard the convict so our other spy doesn't free him." - he said, squinting his eyes at Kate. 
Kate stood up from her chair. "Adrian, where are you?" - she asked. After he stepped forward from the crowd, she beckoned him with a hand movement and started sprinting in some direction away from the block, and Adrian chased after her somewhere.
"What's going on? Where are we running?" - he asked after catching up. 
"The only way we can stop the execution is to get a stronger, older block attack ours and disrupt the procedure. Do you know how to provoke people?"
"It comes... naturally!"
"I know the block's leader. His name is, uhh... Fuck... Oh, yea, Akim. Just lie about something to him to make him angry at our block! His block number is 90!" - she explained the plan. The stumbles were a side effect of being under stress. 
"Got it! But why are they doing this, is this all serious?" - Adrian thought it was all a performance of sort. Well, by this point it was more wishful thinking. 
"Yes! I was at the convention where they agreed to burn spies alive. It's all true!"
"Oh god, what?"
"Exactly! We can still stop it!"
It wasn't that long before they reached the destination block. Adrian had no reason to venture out to higher-digit blocks before since it was considered dangerous. Surprisingly, the  block didn't look any different from any other blocks: it still had similar-looking Starshards going about their day-to-day lives and not smashing bricks against eachothers' 16-packs.
Kate found Akim with her eyes and slowed down a little to be less out of breath by the time she reached him. "The good always triumphs over evil..." - she thought to herself. Akim was an 11 year old Starblood in purple robes speckled with small lightning symbols, and a wizard's cone hat with an identical pattern. He was just peacefully playing cards with friends, and despite what his name would have you believe, he was East Asian. "Hey nineties, we just... wanted to confirm if you like protesters... like-like-like uh... our block 85 leader said you did." - Kate opened. Her plan to not say this while out of breath failed completely.
"We also heard you smell bad... and cheat in tournaments." - Adrian added, ready to turn around and run any moment.
"We're of in the middle of something." - Akim responded, putting his cards to his chest and giving Adrian and Kate a judgemental stare.
"But our leader said bad things about you. Are you not gonna do anything about it?" - Adrian asked with no confidence in his voice.
"You couldn't have picked a worse moment, you know. Fine. We'll come at your block tomorrow at 15. Sounds good?" - Akim answered, like this was just a minor inconvenience to him. Other Starshards at his table also stared judgementally at the duo. 
"No, we need- ohmygod... We are inviting you right now! Come on!" - Kate didn't expect this kind of apathy either, and was completely stumped at what to say to save the situation.
"You got your answer. Now, do you want me to solo both of you right now or are you gonna leave us alone?" - Akim's frustration grew.
"Bet you can't." - Kate dared him. Akim made a movement to stand up, and Adrian and Kate started sprinting back towards their block for a short while. Kate suddenly hit her brakes. "He's not chasing us! W-what the h-fuck?" - she asked, puzzled and frustrated. Akim just went back to his chair and went on with his business. 
"Does he know? Did he catch our bluff or something?" - Adrian also stopped, taking heavy breaths between words. 
"He has to have. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. There's gotta be something else we can do, we can't fail, we have to do something... I have friends in '83. Maybe they can help!" - Kate started panicking. 
The duo sprinted back around the corner on the road with blocks 85 and 83 on it. However, when they made the turn, they saw a pyre in the distance burning hot beside the building of block 85.
Kate and Adrian stopped abruptly. "Is that... No, they couldn't. There's no way." - Adrian said, stepping on his knees to regain his stamina.
"They did it..." - Kate said emptily. The duo could see some kind of a commotion happening in the distance: there was an enormous crowd standing near the block and facing the burning child, though from the distance there was only so much you could make out. "We failed..."
"What if that's not him? They couldn't. They wouldn't. I know my brothers, they would never do anything of the sort."
"It's... There's no sense being in denial, Adrian. They did it. It happened. Our block has lynched a fucker. And I failed him..." - Kate said, full of despair. Adrian haven't heard her use that tone.
As they approached their block, a bunch of adults left its building and ordered everyone to get inside while some stayed behind to clean up the mess. These were the step-parents of Starshards, which were random couples hired to provide children their basic needs, rudimentary education and general parenting necessities. They were also tasked to restore order in case of an emergency like this one, but since these were rare, they mostly just spent most of their day doing white collar jobs on the side. You might also be wondering what happened to the Starshards' real parents. Huh? Stephen? Stephen? Hey Stephen, can you hear me? It seem- Stephen, I apologize, it seems like we are having a technical issue. We'll- we'll try to fix that and get back to you after a quick break.
Block 85 Starshards were forced inside the classroom and given half an hour to sit still so the adults had time to gather up and relay the information, which was followed by an emergency plenary to address the situation. Their weapons were also confiscated. 
"What in the hell is wrong with you all?" - the teacher was walking around the class, expressing shock with hand movements. "I mean, when I signed up to work here, I thought this was exactly what was gonna happen one day, but... Why? Why would you do something so horrible? Don't you realize that was a guy? A person? A human being?" - Mr. Mothersword looked at the class in dread and disdain, the same two feelings Adrian's blockmates often had back toward him.
"But you always taught us, we shouldn't let spies infiltrate our country." - Nate started defending the execution completely calmly. "Anyone new in your surroundings could be a spy. Don't share secrets with people you barely know." - around 14 of Nathan's blockmates said in unison when they recognized where the phrase was going.
"That's not what that was ever about! Why- no, no, okay, let's just calm down-" - Mothersword got interrupted. 
"Here's something which was never a secret: it's all Nate's fault! Kate for block leader!" - Julia shouted.
"You're shorter than my legs and you don't eat soup, Julia! You're worthless! Your word means nothing!" - Nathan shouted back at her. The class started quickly descending into a sensory armageddon, forcing Adrian to shut off his ears. 
"It was all a psyop orchestrated by Kate! Stefan was paid off from her wallet!" - Paul yelled on his own over a couple other yells. 
After that, the angry words of the Starshards got amalgamated into a terrifying eldritch monstrosity completely devoid of any intelligibility. Or intelligence. The teacher raised an arm, then pulled out a device from his pocket. A few students blocked their ears in advance, a few others begged "No!/Please, no!", and Mothersword shut his own ears with index fingers and flicked a switch on the device with his right thumb. A loud, ear-destroying, high-pitched sound blasted the whole room, causing the rest of the class to shut off their ears and scream from pain. It was dubbed by the kids as the Wail Of A Thousand Babies, a name the sound more than earned. 
The teacher then turned off the device. Adrian felt as if millions of voices cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced, his voice among them: same as every other time. A particular Starshard went for the motion of stabbing her arm with a dagger she made on the spot right after it was over, though she thankfully resisted, and that was only from the volume being at its peak for 3 seconds. The teacher, of course, had lower sensitivity to high pitched noise thanks to his age, and was perfectly fine. He intentionally took 10 more seconds after turning off the sound before proceeding. "Ahem. Listen. Let's go step by step where your logic was wrong. First, everyone around you is guaranteed to have been born in the Motherland, which means there can't be any spies around. It's impossible. This facility has the kind of security Iron Fist wouldn't penetrate in a century." - that was the mother of all overexaggerations. "Second, you weren't taught to murder any spies you found. You were taught to catch and detain the spies, then call the authorities so they're put in a supermax security prison and interrogated, but that's not your business, by the time they get there, you would have done your part. Third, my higher-ups really wanted me to address this even though it's the list of your worries: immolation is a quick, relatively painless way to kill a person and it's extremely outdated. It's the way the Motherland's enemies probably do it, or how it used to be done in the United States before the Summer of Suffering because it's "humane" or something, but here in the glorious Omnislavian Social Republic we do things differently." - he highlighted the full official name of the country by pronouncing it in an extra pompous and proud way, though a third of the block could feel the difference between saying that sincerely and the way he did. "The modern, more proper ways to execute someone include one - starvation. Two - stoning, the Muslim classic. The Turkish live and breathe it. It's usually done with small stones so it takes longer." - he counted these with his hand. The Turkish were getting way more fire than usual for the last couple of years due to Omnislavia entering war with Turkey, and it was hard to filter truth from hyperbole, though most never bothered to even try. "Three - impaling their body with growing bamboo. I can show you a video some other time, a person is placed horizontally and bamboo is planted underneath them. It grows in a matter of days and penetrates their body, causing a slow and painful death." - no child so much as felt anything, let alone reacted. "Four, lingxi, or Death by a Thousand Cuts. It's a Chinese procedure of slowly adding a thousand cuts to a person's body in perfect places to prolong and maximize the target's suffering. It's a perfectly optimized and refined masterpiece of the ancient craft of murder. Five, drawing and quartering." - and he proceeded to detail that too. A sizable minority of Starshards disengaged out of boredom at this point, but a larger minority was instead all ears. "Do you understand?"
"Yes." - the class replied.
"Alright. Now that's that sorted, the whole block gets 7 weeks of detention." - and it felt like a million voices cried out in terror once again. "I meant 7 days of detention, sorry, I didn't expect I'd have to lecture my class about why murder is bad today, with an asterisk. " - Mothersword remarked with frustration. This was still an antimatter bomb evaporating Earth level of calamity for the children, though it was still 7 times better than before. Detention in media understated how extreme it was in reality.
The Starshards wanted to say something, but the fear of the Wail didn't let them. "But Kate was against it from the start..." - Tina said sadly, with the comment taking her entire bar of willpower and then some. 
"They wanted to give you two weeks to teach you how to take shared responsibility for your actions. I thought it was too cruel even by our standards, I did my best to make it a little easier. If you learn how to take that shared responsibility, I might be able to do more." - the last sentence was a lie, the teacher did not genuinely believe there was anything more to be done. The other sentences were all true, though. "I'll see you all tomorrow." - he then left upstairs to the apartments, everyone silently following him with their eyesight before he disappeared and the steps stopped. 
Havoc ensued only a few seconds after he left: some started screaming in despair, a few boys lunged at Nathan and *name* for taking the whole block with them. The young lady in the blue dress rolled her eyes overlooking it from her lone desk. 
Adrian sat next to Kate at the desk. "Good thing our ways of recreation didn't need much phones anyway. Wanna show me off your skills, like you wanted?" - he asked.
"Adrian, I... Not now. I- I don't know how to describe... Later, okay?" - she mumbled with a strained voice, unable to properly convey in words that she was tired. 
"Hey, sure thing. It was fun... Wait, no, no, it was not." - Adrian backtracked. 
"I know, right..." - she kept looking somewhere to the right where Paul and Nathan were throwing fists, teeth and knees at eachother. Others nearby were fighting too. 
"Stop! Stop, we don't need more of-of... Of this." - Kate requested, pushing the last bit of mental capacity she had left. Her word actually worked, and the bedlam ceased. "It-it-it won't solve anything. It won't cancel our predicament."
"Good to be on the same page." - Nathan remarked.
"Shut up." - Kate resisted saying, only letting "Sh..." come out, though it would have felt good to let the whole phrase out. But again, she even wasn't sure about that much anymore. "W-whatever happens, we need to rest. We've been through hell today. Let's just lie down here and rest, and then worry about how do we endure the rest of the week."
Most children agreed, picked a spot to lie down and laid down to nap or to screw around with whatever they had. There wasn't exactly a lot of room on the carpet, but those who didn't call dibs on any spot on the carpet just picked a spot on the vynil flooring, it really wasn't so bad.
Two and a half hours later, most of the Starshards were well enough rested to start to acclimate *verify wording* boredom. 
A few boys were sitting in a circle. "What do you think, boss? We're probably well-rested well enough by now. What's the plan?" - Paul asked Nathan completely genuinely, with no sarcasm or implicit mockery.
"Good question. I say we don't obey the adults and their tyrannical manipulation. We sit tight and endure the wait. Like men of steel!" - Nate made a fist.
"Men of steel? Like robots?" - Pete asked.
"No... Wait, it does actually fit. I wanted to say men with balls of steel." - Nathan then stood up and raised his fist. "You hear me, adults? The indomitable Starshard spirit will never be crushed!" - he shouted.
It would have sounded pretty inspiring if a blockmate with second to most de-facto authority didn't mock him for it afterwards. "Let me guess. Since you're a Starblood, things apply a bit differently to you and your indomitable spirit would be crushed instantly?" - Kate grinned at him from the distance.
"Do you have any better suggestions, Kate, or do you just want to disrupt the environment?" 
"Just wanted to express how much I hate you." - she said with a friendly tone. "The way I see it about your 'plan'," - she made the quote unquote sign with her hands - "You're not really suggesting anything the adults didn't intend you to do, so there is no rebellion in that decision."
"So then we do nothing? And hope we endure?"
"I guess./Yea." - Kate and Nathan spoke over eachother. Not intentionally.
Another two hours later, Kate and Adrian were sitting at a desk together.
"That's okay. You're still getting better. Just don't forget to pay attention to subconsciously drawing eyelids instead of ovals at the tops of these cylinders. That's 4 eyelids in a row." - Kate watched as Adrian was learning how to draw, all the while a sensory chaos was unfolding in the background. "Yes, that's what you wanna see. I thought paper would be a lot worse than this after doing enough digital art, but man, this sentence might not be so bad." - then she muffled her voice a little. "Do you think I could draw the squad a picture of me, Jules, Tina and Vi-" - she then coughed. "...and Karen together? There's plenty of time, that's for sure."
Meanwhile, havoc returned to the classroom, which was also the detention room. Some were screaming, some were fighting, some fighting, and Karen was just reading a book and chilling.
"Meeting!" - Nathan started repeating over and over, standing near the teacher's desk and the turned-off smartboard. There was no hope turning it on: the smartboard and the laptop connected to it were locked by a physical key the teacher barely parted ways with.
"IT'S UNBEARABLE! I HAVE TO GET MY DAILY BONUS IN LIKE 5 GAMES! HOW COULD THEY DO THIS TO US??" - Julia shouted in despair.
"I know, my friends are probably wondering if I am dead! I want to tell them! We must escape this place somehow!" - Pete suggested. He may not have been shouting, but he was also pretty damn distressed.
"Okay, I hate to ask it, Kate, but do you have any ideas? We won't last a week like this. We need to train and exercise to maintain the streak, too." - Nate said, embarassed at the idea of having to work together with who basically became his archnemesis by now.
"I also hate to say it, but I have no idea. He said we need to learn to take responsibility, which could point out to a way we could get out of this faster. It could very well just mean we should tank and endure it however we can." - Kate continued sitting next to Adrian, still relatively unbothered by the whole thing, though she did want to do whatever she could to resolve the situation for the sake of others. Adrian was not paying attention to the discussion at all, just doodling away.
"He said 'shared responsibility'. Key word is shared. They wanted us to work together to get out of this. We must start a class-wide group project and show them we can work together." - an irritated voice from the back of the bus was heard, and the entire block wad muffled when they heard her speak.
"And how do *you* know that?" - Kate asked, facing backwards. 
"Kill yourself."
Most were a little shocked by the answer, but Kate already expected that kind of attitude. "Show them we can work together, right, Victoria? You miserable hypocrite." - she frowned. An awkward silence fell on the classroom. 
"You know her?" - Adrian asked in surprise, breaking the ice. Kate took a deep breath and made a nod.
"So, shared responsibility! Class-wide project. Work together to show that we're not evil. Show the adults that we're very sorry for executing, what's his name again? Whatever, and that we won't do it again. Raise your hand if anyone have any ideas for what projects we could go for. No filters, just anything that comes to mind." - Nathan continued with a mildly nervous tone, eager to defuse tension for a change. "What do you got, Liz?" - he pointed at the girl. 
"An extremely large drawing which shows us all holding hands under the colors of white, blue, red and yellow?" - Lisa suggested, referencing the Omnislavian quadricolor.
"Alright, a huge drawing. What about you, Kate?" 
"You're pointing at Karen, dickass!" - Tina corrected him.
"It's fine... I was thinking we could write a song. About how our teacher is great and how we are proud warriors of the Motherland. Is that good?" - Karen suggested awkwardly, and no, it was, in fact, not fine.
"Patriotic song. Okay. Tyler?" - Nate poined in the back of the class somewhere.
"How about we just shit in a box and give it to the adults as present? That's what they really deserve from us." - the boy suggested.
"We're not doing that and you're not doing that, and if you try to do that, we're gonna bathe you in bathtub of shit." - Nathan shut him down. 
After another while of deciding what to go with, the block started working together ingroups on each project. The first group went to work on the huge painting, the second to write and recite a happy patriotic song, the third - an apology dance, and the forth to write a huge poem for how good the Motherland is in a team effort. There was a fifth block for those who were so destructive or incompetent that they were excluded completely for the price of owing each of their blockmates a token after the fact, and the children also vetted a couple of other projects, notably the Pencilman of Omnislavia or a large bribe. Both Adrian and Kate went into the painting camp, with Adrian handling more monotone but important tasks while Kate, among others, did the actual cooking. I could further elaborate on logistics, but it would stall the pacing. 
By the next morning, their work was mostly complete. A few perfectionists claimed otherwise, but most agreed it was ready to be presented to the adults. Contrary to how the Starshards expected the lesson to proceed as usual and how they expected to have to approach the teacher during a school break, Mr. Mothersword opened the first class with a line:
"So, do you have anything to show me?"
It took Kate a few moments to realize what was going on, and she began her line. "Dear teacher. To show you how well we became versed in the art of shared responsibility, we have decided to let a completely random blockmate of ours to lead the presentation to show you that we have all learnt our lesson. Please pick a number from 1 to 20." - she requested, still not actually having any idea what the hell "shared responsibility" stood for exactly, though to be fair to her, neither did her teacher. The whole rest of the class was dead silent, anticipating what happens next. 
"Thirteen." - the teacher asked without much thinking. 
Kate started doing some planned manipulations with the number. "That lands on... Adrian? Oh wow." - it might sound like she rigged it, but no, when others doublechecked it, it indeed fell on Adrian. 
"Me? Oh f-" - Adrian coughed, straightened up and started after Kate have him the list with the order of showcases. "We have worked hard yesterday as one to prove how we are capable of being united together as one. One of the masterpieces we made as a result of our singular unity was the following painting drawn from the bottom of our hearts." - he said, with the pressure hurting his ability to build his sentences well. During practice, he was a lot better at conveying the element of shared responsibility while successfully masking the amount of redundancy in his sentences.
The painting team excluding Adrian went to the side of the class to hold the large painting they made earlier in the air in front of the smartboard. The painting was absolutely huge, around 6 stingrays in area (~2.7 square meters), and even assembling the canvas was a bitch and a half: it was made from cardboard as a structural backbone, paper and a fuckton of taping everything together. Mothersword observed the result in all its beauty: he was drawn in the middle of it in the artstyle of Christian icons and in a pose of a Christian saint, but instead of a cross, he held a small Omnislavian flag. To the sides of his face, there were different Starshards facing him and doing the Omnislavian salute of putting your right fist against the temple: Nathan, Bill, Karen, Adrian, others. Nathan was to the other side throwing a giant fireball a group of darker-skinned people marked as "Turks". Written underneath the caption, "(the ones from the nation of turkee)" clarified the very important difference between fiery loyalty to Omnislavia and prejudice. On the other side, there was a lady in the light-blue white-dotted dress. She was standing near a giant globe and was painting Europe and Turkey with yellow by using corpses as toothbrushes, one in each hand. The Omnislavian territory, including pretty much the entire Easter Europe and formerly independent nations to the right of the Black Sea, were all painted yellow already. The corpses did not have the right to be as absurdly high-quality as they were: they had mangled eyes, bullet holes, scars, dripping blood - it made Francisco Goya's work look almost infantile in comparison. Similarly to the Mothersword's central icon, that fragment of the painting stood out from the rest in quality and polish, even though the rest of it already looked great. The top right and top left were covered with drawings of dogfights to help the underdecorated sky. Finally, there was an elegant thick border with a moderately overdecorated pattern. The teacher was impressed with the effort, even though he had to hide the fact that he found the whole work more disturbing than the murder the children committed.
Next, came the poems. Since the projects had groups in their common theme and poems were more commonly done solo, the Starshards have decided to have one person write one section. *also not in the mood but make it funny*
Finally, a small vocal ensemble which included Nathan went in front of the class under Adrian's command to sing a lovely song. All 6 Starshards in the song group had a paper with the lyrics so they didn't need to learn it by heart and screw up massively when it mattered: it was a reasonable compromise considering how much of a complete bedlam the creation and repetition of this song were. 
"*i am really not in the mood for this, it's also gonna be completely fucked up, nationalistic, mildly cringe and violent*" 
The group's efforts to perfect their performance of the song in the little time they had paid off, with not a single audible voice crack or a rhythmic failure. Then again, their success would have had what they perceived as life and death difference. The teacher could feel it too: the disparity between their barely passing performance during actual school and this chilling masterpiece was enormous, yet at the same time the thought of them always being like this wasn't very appealing, or pleasant. 
The poems took

 If that was a Starblood, you absolutely would have gotten 7 weeks and then some.


I don't think any single collective should unconditionally be punished for crimes of one of its members, so responsibility could mean anything.

He starts writing suggestions on blackboard. He writes "song about teacher and motherland", "a huge painting of the teacher and us", "a poem about how awesome the motherland is", "a large bribe" (Nathan talks about how everyone has money left from not paying Victoria who ends up visibly fuming). An outcast kid suggests that they make a present to the teacher which will have a huge poo inside of it, to which Nathan responds, "We're not doing that and you're not doing that, and if you try to do that, we're gonna bathe you in bathtub of shit because that'd put us into even more trouble than we're already in." Adrian quietly starts being upset about how many of his classmates are irredeemable sociopaths.

Nathan allows the class to divide itself into who handles which. Nathan joins the painting team. After being done, Nathan calls the teacher and tells him that the class has worked together to show how much they love the Motherland and him. He comes around and sits down for a show.

The song comes off as really wholesome and yet at the same time very violent and nasty. Some students are shocked, but the teacher pretends to like it. The picture shows the class worshipping the teacher as a god and the class having their swords and fists in the air, and also random parts where the light girl is stabbing a kid with a lightsaber and the ice girl turning someone into an icicle. The teacher asks about those, and gets the reply that some students are worried about the light girl and the ice girl bullying them. Adrian cracks a smile that hides his inner pain. The teacher ignores the bad parts and gives the students a thumbs up.

A few kids are starting to read a poem glazing the teacher and the motherland. The teacher accepts it and forgives everyone, allowing them to go outside. Then he goes to his restroom and starts thinking "What have we turned these kids into? What have I been turned into?" and starts chugging vodka.

Break

Adrian sees in the distance that the block B0090 kids are practicing for combat. Adrian and Kate try to warn everyone of the incoming attack by the 90's. Everyone ignores them. They try to get oil so they can light it up to counter the other kids' superior strength, but Kate's dad refuses, saying it's too dangerous, and they should use powdered sleeping gas instead because it's non lethal, so the duo buy gas masks together and some vials of powdered sleeping gas. Later, the invading kids arrive, at the forefront of the group stands a kid with a wizard looking hat and starts flexing his lightning powers. The home block kids quickly prepare for battle with the little time they had, Nathan and the lightning kid have a cool anime dialogue and the groups charge at one another. Kate and Adrian arrive from the corner and cover invaders in sleeping gas, which works way too effectively and makes kids on both sides cough. Very quickly after that the lightning kid orders retreat and tells the homeblock kids that they cheated and they'll be back with chemical weapons aswell. Nathan tells him that nobody told anyone to use the powdered sleeping gas, to no avail. After the invaders leave, Adrian and Kate are confronted about their little trick and are blamed for it. They defend themselves saying they have no idea the neighboring blocks declared a treaty which says no chemical weapons a few years back, to which Kate replies she wasn't invited as she was a girl and had no part in the past wars between blocks, and Adrian says that he wasn't invited because he wasn't told because he probably wasn't important enough. Later the boys and Kate hold a meeting for how should they survive the 90s' next attack. They agree to buy gas masks to protect themselves against chemical weapons. One boy starts flaming the main duo for causing this whole thing, but Nathan tells him that Kate and Adrian will have their asses kicked later. Kate says that the lab rules forbid boys from attacking girls, but in turn she is told that her ass will be kicked by other girls, and then told that if they contribute to the meeting or the fight enough, they will be spared. Ice girl says she can provide everyone with very cold ice swords that hurt like hell on touch for everyone but her, and also demonstrates her ice ball shattering into shotgun projectiles. Then she says that she'll need 200 tokens for her services, to which everyone is shocked once again. Some are saying how it's preposterous, Kate directly accuses her of being an apathetic sociopath, but Victoria refuses to back down. After she leaves, the boys decide to study overtime to get enough money to hire her and get the gas masks, while Kate says she and Adrian can get help from elsewhere, to which the boys eventually decide to agree to.

The duo walk to block 83, saying she has friends there. On the way there, Kate talks about how all this violence is very wrong and that it's very weird the parents and stuff do nothing to stop it. When they arrive, she's greeted very warmly by her friends. One of the friends is a light mage who demonstrates that she can burn a rotten apple to a crisp and offers her services for a small favor: she wants the duo to secretly record the voices of Nathan, his gf, and the boy leader of block 83. Adrian handles the latter (through telling him about the block 90 starting wars again and about the events of the last couple days), Kate handles the primary two. The block 85 boys are also shown how they feel exhausted and completely unfocused on the overtime lessons. Kate also claims to have managed to embezzle 25 tokens from Nathan and shares some with Adrian. After bringing the recordings, the light girl agrees to help block B0085 with the invaders. They return to their home block with the good news and decide to risk it and not buy the ice girl's services. She tries to lower the price, but is still refused, then she walks away sad.

When the invaders arrive once again with gas masks, the light girl easily cuts through them with a budget lightsaber, inflicting heavy burns on them and their clothes. The wizard kid from the invader block orders everyone to stop and challenges the light girl to a duel which would decide the course of battle, and she agrees. They have an epic anime battle for a bit, and eventually the light girl wins. She demands 100 tokens from the opposing team and threatens to attack them again, to which the wizard agrees and hands her over 100 tokens. After the invaders walk away, the home block kids start demanding a cut of that money, which eventually turns into a fight. The light girl challenges anyone who wants a cut to fight and win against her, so Nathan goes forward and is quickly defeated, so she runs away and everyone in block 85 starts fighting one another. Kate and Adrian walk away, say goodbye and go to their rooms. Then, Ice girl touches Adrian with her hand, and tells him how he stole 150 tokens from him and that he will suffer for that. He says that he was doing his best to protect the block from invaders, to which he gets victim blamed and gaslit. He says in his thoughts that he is unable to do anything, because it's illegal to attack a girl for a boy even in self defense, and it's not like he could do anything at all. He's eventually saved by his teacher who says that if he's bullied for too much longer, he'll get frostbitten, so she lets him go for now. In pain from being cold, he slowly walks home, opens the door, and yells for his parents to help him. After he is put in bed and fed some warm tea, he is told that he saved his local block and is an absolute hero.

S1E4 Liars, Cheats and Other Proud Omnislavians (The Truth Is Long Dead) 
Maybe replace this chapter with a chapter about how adults tried to feed children slop entertainment and it failed miserably or something. also make it so lumina and jason were never in the same block 

\*lumina is too obviously evil fix it ffs\*

A class ends and everyone goes outside. Adrian notices a crying, and thinks huh, weird. Goes outside, sees a bunch of boys aggressively discussing something between one another. Kate approaches Adrian and they greet each other.

"I need your help. A dude has posted a video on our local LabSocial about a few kids in our class, including a friend of mine, saying disgusting things they would never actually say, and we need to get to the bottom of it."

"What kind of things did they say?"

"Let me show you on my phone, I have one of the links opened. "

A video of Lisa sucking a poorly drawn dick is played, with her saying "I am a stupid slut and I like to masturbate to my parents. I've had my clit touched by 23 people one day and I aim to beat that record."

"I think that's Lisa's voice."

"As annoying as she is, we're all in this together. I've also managed to track down whoever posted all these, and it was all posted from the account of Jason from block 83."

"Isn't that the block's leader? Oh boy. "

"Yes. He seemed to be a nice guy when I met him, but who knows. Even people who appear perfectly nice on the outside can have very rotten insides as you dive deeper into their character. "

Adrian thinks for a second. "No- Idk. I haven't encountered manipulation before."

"Oh you have. Remember when the boys gaslit you into swordcrafting duty when you wanted to go home and play?"

"What's gaslighting? "

"Manipulating someone into questioning whenever they're right or wrong. What I am saying is, you were manipulated into doing the chores for the other boys by being falsely convinced that you failed everyone else by underperforming in a previous battle."

"I think I remember being puzzled where was I underperforming exactly. It felt like I was helping."

"Exactly!"

"That's so much to take in right now. I had no idea."

"Back to my main point. The videos were posted from the account of Jason, however it was Lumina who asked us to get her the voice recordings. "

"So are you saying we helped this happen? You're not gaslighting me or anything?"

"Why would I do that, silly? Yes, we did help this happen, but the difference is, I don't want you to feel bad right now because it's counterproductive to fixing the problem. And besides, she would have obtained those voice recordings one way or the other. "

"Aren't you trying to get me to do something just like the boys back in the day? "

"I don't want you to do it because you did something wrong and you need to make up for it, I want you to help me because it's just and because we're facing another crisis that could result in a battle of everyone against everyone."

"I think I understand the difference. Thank you."

"You're always welcome." She pets Adrian on the head, much to his pleasure. "As I was saying, Lumina was getting those recordings, Jason posted them, her friends Kelly and Lola were around when she asked us to get the photos. We can't trust any of them. "

"Guys! Guys! I am sorry to interrupt but we have a problem. " Lumina suddenly appears.

"Oh hey, Lumi. What's up?"

"Haven't you heard that Jason allegedly posted all those nasty videos on LabSocial? "

"Yea, I was wondering how'd that happen, considering you asked me for the voice recordings which would be perfect to make AI voices. But I know you wouldn't do that to us, right? "

"God no, of course not! I think one of my friends is out of control. After all 3 of us acquired the AI capable of making voice modules, we used it to screw around a little with eachother without telling anyone. But then today happens and neither one of them would admit it's her. Can you help me check which one of them has the flash drive with the AI in their computer?"

"Damn. Did any of them ever say they wanted to do that? "

"Kelly said it once, but we've all agreed not to do it. I guess we didn't agree hard enough." They laugh.

"Then let's do it. Let's invite Adrian and Kate for a dinner with the suspects and let him sneak into Kelly's room so he could check if the flash drive is there, while Kate checks Lola's room. After the classes, we all meet near my block and we fix this together."

"Yasss, you're the best!"

"Not as best as you!"

"I mean, I am down."

"Hell yea, Adie, you're also amazing! Really happy to know you! "

"Huh. Thanks." He walks away as the girls continue talking. Adrian walks close to the crowd of boys.

"I am tired of everyone pushing us around. We are the block 85 and we're not to be trifled with! Let us all arm ourselves to the teeth and kick their asses today after classes!"

\*Hooray!"

Adrian casually walks away, goes behind a corner, and types Kate, "The boys will attack block 83 today after classes. What do we do? "

"Damn it; We'll have to be fast then."

During classes, Vlad asks the teacher:

"Mr. Mothersword, what do we do if someone uses AI voice generator to troll everyone?"

"That's impossible. How would a student obtain such an AI? There's no way to smuggle anything in here and that AI is only available to the rulers of Motherland. "

"Look up the trending videos of LabSocial. Seriously."

"Alright, alright."

"Hey there, I am a gay little boy and i like to rub my tiny dick against a wall to mark my territory. Every time i see anyone, a boy, a girl, a robot, a tree, or my own asshole, I can't help but try to fuck them-", the video says before it's paused

"What the fuck is wrong with whoever did this? ", the teacher says as someone barfs and several people start screaming, some others start laughing, and the target starts crying.

A cut to the control tower.

"Oh man, what a good way to do nothing and get paid way too much money. Oh shit, someone's calling. Hello, this is the control tower. What's wrong? Ah don't worry about it, he is in jail. We should probably delete the posts to prevent the children from being traumatized before they're even on the battlefield. Anyway, bye!"

Adrian arrives to block 83 to proceed with the mission. All 4 girls greet him, and they go inside to get some foods.

As they're eating, the girls are talking girl stuff between eachother and are paying no attention to Adrian. Kate excuses herself to Lola's room. After eating half the food, he excuses himself to Kelly's room aswell. It's open with no problems. He sits at her PC, and right off the bat notices a few flash drives put in it, detecting that one of them is supposed to be the one with the AI. There's also a folder on the desktop with some AI voices. Adrian starts calling Kate, but senses someone coming close to the door. He turns off the monitor, stands up and pretends to look around. When the door opens, and Kelly walks in.

"Hey, who said you could come in here? "

"Oh, sorry, I was told you have a beautiful room and that I need to check it out."

"Don't lie to me. What are you actually here to do? "

Adrian thinks for a few seconds. Then Kelly notices, "Whoa. Why is the monitor turned off and the computer turned on? Look, whatever you saw in there, be quiet about it, okay? I'll give you all my tokens for your silence. "

Before he can answer, Kelly's dad walks behind. "Kelly, Kelly, Kelly."

"Yes, daddy? "

"Can you please sit down on the bed and not go anywhere while I check your PC for something? You, out of the way. "

Adrian and Kelly watch. Eventually, Kelly gives Adrian a middle finger, to which he shrugs.

"Well, there's illegal AI in there, definitely. Illegally recorded voice samples of several people too, looks like. Sorry, sunshine, it looks like your friends won't see you again."

Realizing the gravity of the situation, she starts crying. Adrian tries to walk out of the room, but is stopped by the dad.

"Hey, before you go, can you tell me why have I found you invading a room of a girl that's not even from this block?"

"Sir, I was invited here and I've been tasked to bring justice to those who have trolled the internet last night."

"Oh, let me guess, it's that bitch Lumina, wasn't it? " Adrian looks at her in disbelief. "We were just having good preteen fun, when she decided that she wants to plunge every block into chaos through AI trolling, the worst kind of trolling. We objected. But she went ahead with it anyway. We kept quiet, hoping it would just blow up in her face, or Jason's, but the weasley whore specifically framed us before inviting you to this dinner!"

"I've been just told that it's only you and Lola who had the forbidden AI in your PC's. Lumina did not."

"That slut, she deleted everything! Or put it in a flash drive!"

"We checked for recovered deleted files and have found nothing illegal." Kelly starts screaming." Anyway, you can go now, Adrian. "

And so he went and left the apartment to find Lumina and Kate outside.

"Welcome back, bestie! What was the hold up?"

"Kelly caught me in the act. Then her dad arrived and caught her with the forbidden AI files. Then she went on and on how you were the manipulator and how she was your victim."

"Of course she did. Anyone would tell that lie to save her ass, but I can assure you, she was the manipulator. Both of them were. And now they're gone, along with Jason. That'll teach them not to fuck with me."

"Girl, noone would fuck with those laser eyes. No thank you."

The home block invaders arrive. "What seems to be the problem, gentlemen? ", asks Lumina.

"Your leader trolled a bunch of our classmates! We're here to beat the shit out of everyone native to this block!"

"The problem has been solved. Go home, play video games and masturbate, or whatever you people do. If you're gonna be a problem, I'll be a solution."

"Well, we'll trust you're not bullshitting us. Adrian, you coming?"

"Sure. See you around, Lumi."

"Bye!"

S1E5 I Don't Know, Sport, I Guess (need a better title)

Adrian is sparring with a roommate of his. Then, a girl offers him a vial of weird rainbow gas. "We've been sold gas that takes you to the wonderful rainbow world where everything is awesome! Come on, get some! It's only 3 tokens a vial!"

"Yea, sure. This better be real." - says Adrian.

"Don't ingest it just yet! We'll all be ingesting it together tomorrow after classes, all at once!"

"So is the plan to become rulers of the rainbow world or something! "

"Yea! "

"Awesome!"

"Well, see you, guys! And don't tell our teacher about this if you don't wanna get burnt alive!"

"Jeez, girl name, why does everyone in this world like murder so much? Isn't it scary what it's like on the other side, even a little?"

And by the time he's finished, she was too far away to hear or answer him.

"Oh come on, Adrian, it's not so bad. If you've lived a good life you'll get to go to heaven after death where all your dreams will come true!"

"Fair enough. I still feel like dying would be very painful and i would like not to die because of that. "

"That's your choice. Personally, as long as I get to fight someone, I don't care!"

"Let's get back to it then."

Cut to Kate spying on who is bringing the shipments of the rainbow gas to the home block. It's a weird stagecoach powered by 2 go carts and she's chasing it on a bicycle. She manages to track the stagecoach to block 74, where it parks and stops and some people gather around it. She was about to spy on them a little more, but then she notices it's 21:00 and rides back to go to sleep.

Tomorrow after first class is over, she comes to Adrian and tells him:

"Adrian, morning, how are you? "

"I am alright, what's up?"

"Yesterday I found out that someone is selling some sort of narcotic substance to everyone, have you heard anything about that?"

"No?"

"You sure? Well, there's a stagecoach going around the lab selling bulks of that demonic rainbow gas, and apparently most of our class got some and is preparing to consume it all today, it's gonna be total-"

"Wait, hold on a minute, you mean this thing?"

"Why do you have this, give it here!" Kate tries to grab it so recklessly it falls out of his hands and breaks, colliding with the ground. Kate quickly notices what she has done and steps back a few steps and says "Get away from it! It causes whoever takes it to go insane!", as Adrian just stands looking at it in shock, eventually starting to step away from it but then the gas starts kicking in and he starts collapsing. As he collapses, he hears "Nooooo!". Screen fades to black, and after it's back to normal, he stands up and sees a psychodelic rainbow land, saying "Whoa". He walks around, and sees a beautiful castle nearby. As he walks to it, he sees his mom telling him, "Welcome, son, to the magical rainbow land thing! Come on, your friends are waiting for you inside."

"Woooow, coool!"

As they get in, they walk into a room with a big table. At the table, a bunch of animals and classmates of his sit, cheering him on and everything.

"Welcome in, you wonderful human being! Have a seat!" - says a cute white goat.

He tries to sit down, but it doesn't go super well. His mom helps him sit properly and pats him on the head. "It's okay, you're home."

"This is all so beautiful. I heard the guys wanna invade this place and become the rulers of it, because it's just so awesome and cool."

"Not this this place in particular, sweetie. They want to invade another magical realm, and they will succeed. But it won't affect you or us at all! We're your friends, and we love you with all our hearts! "

"Yea! Love you, Addie!" - says everyone.

"Love you too, guys."

Adrian starts eating sweet cakes and drinking all kinds of juices and enjoying himself. But then, he sees how the roof of the castle is broken by void tendrils and some of the beings are taken away, the rest start to scream, then the Devil breaks through and impales his dad on a hellish trident, some beings spontaneously start burning alive, until a thick blizzard takes over, and Victoria jumps from the skies and starts pouring ice cubes on Adrian, telling everyone, "Who wants some loser ice cream?" and everyone laughs. Then Adrian screams very loudly and screen fades to black. He wakes up to see the dark, bleak world before him. A group of children has gathered around him.

"Is he awake?"

"God damn it, Adrian, we told you not to ingest this gas before the classes are over! What happened to one for all, all for one?"

"What happened? What did you see? "

"Guys… Please, kill me. I don't wanna live anymore. There was the void tendrils, Satan, my friends burning alive, and Victoria turning me into a popsicle…"

Victoria smiled and walked away.

"You looked like you were having fun there for a moment."

"You guys don't understand! The rainbow lamd was destroyed! All my friends and family, even those who weren't real, gone!"

"Is it the substance or is he just a sissy?"

"It seems like it makes you trip like balls, and according to Kate, he barely ingested anything. This is gonna be a fun afternoon."

"Guys, don't you see what it did to him? It showed him his dreams, then took them away in the most gruesome fashion! You guys will go insane, too! " - said Kate.

"Yea, right. Come on, guys, let's rewatch the video we've recorded of him tripping. "

"A video? Oh fuck. "

"Can you stand, homie?"

Adrian felt a little better from being called that, so with a lot of effort and help, he managed to sort of stand up. "Come on, we need to notify our peers of this crisis."

Cut to the medical room, where Kate is explaining what's going on.

"...So we watched him trip on this gas for some time, and when he woke up he said he wanted to die."

"Yes, kill me! I want to go back to the adorable goat and my dream versions of mom and dad."

"See?"

"I understand. Thank you, Kate. \*calls someone\* Attention control tower, some kids have started using some kind of a rainbow gas that makes one trip, one kid in particular seems to have caught a whiff and after the trip was over he claimed that he wants to die and go back to the rainbow world."

"The fuck? Are you tripping?"

"I swear it's serious, this kid is in severe emotional distress. He's covering his face with hands right now."

"You better be right about this. Search everyone and take their rainbow gas."

"Roger that."

Cut to the perpetrator using some sort of magic to turn the rainbow gas almost invisible.

Cut to the teacher and parents of the class searching everyone and everyone's rooms for the gas, but they only find seemingly empty vials, which aren't taken away from anyone. The teacher reports to the control tower that the students only seem to have empty vials instead of the rainbow gas.

Cut to the doctor getting a call from the control tower.

"Yes?"

"Sir, we've searched everyone, but the vials with the rainbow gas were empty. It's either you lied to us, or the kids somehow managed to find a way to quickly dispose of it before we could notice. "

"Then I guess we wait and see. I'll see what I can do about the affected kid."

He tries to council Adrian, asking him about the situation, but it doesn't work.

"It's okay, your friends are alive and well."

"It's not okay, they're all dead. And those that you would call my real friends are just looking for an excuse to burn me alive."

"Your mom and dad are here, though. Kate is here aswell. "

"They weren't the same ones as in the dream. The ones in the dream will never return. They all died. I want to die with them aswell. "

"You can't give up just yet. Be a man, you have a great future to live for."

"No I don't. Everybody hates me. The world wants me to suffer. Even you want me to suffer by continuing being alive."

The doctor pauses for a long moment, then calls someone. "This is doctor \*name\*, we have a kid who has seemingly been traumatized by a bad trip from a drug none of the adults seem to be able to get their hands on, and I don't think I can help him. He keeps saying how he wants to die and hyperbolizes how bad his life is. "

"No, I don't!"

"You serious? There's noone around with a higher qualification? Oh man."

Cut to Kate standing in class near the teacher. The whole class is in uproar.

"Kids, calm down. Now, let's ask both sides of the argument to explain in detail what the fuck just happened. Kate, you start."

"They sold him the rainbow gas, then when I tried to take it from him, the vial with the gas broke, he didn't react in time and ingested some of the gas and started tripping. While he was on the ground tripping, everyone watched and was getting excited for the big party where everyone ingests the gas at the same time today after classes. Don't you all realize the size of the disaster that's about to happen today?"

"That's a good point, Kate. Do you know who's selling this rainbow gas? "

"I've tracked the stagecoach with the gas and it was block B0074. "

"Hmm. Thank you. Now you, Nathan."

"We were framed, we were never going to consume any rainbow gas. Adrian probably bought some LSD or antidepressants or antipsychotics from outside this class and tripped on them." Kate is visibly fuming.

"So what were you going to do today after classes?" - asks the teacher.

"Attack block 83, what else?"

"YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT, NATHAN, AND YOU KNOW IT!"

"Kate, calm down, I understand you're upset, but yelling at anyone isn't going to solve anything. Now, let's all get back to our desks and just pretend we're having the most normal time of day imaginable, that Adrian isn't in deep psychological pain from a bad trip, that half the class isn't going to kill eachother the moment the next break starts, and… I think I need a moment, kids, can you all open your books on page 278 and start looking at the new material? Thank you." He starts moving toward his room. The moment the door closes, everyone instantly starts yelling at eachother.

Cut to the teacher consuming hashish. "I don't know how much more of this I can take. "

Cut to Kate going outside and going to a secluded corner. Lisa yells at her, "I'd beat your ass to the ground if we weren't forbidden to attack one another for the rest of the day!"

"Sister, you'd be joining Adrian in the hospital if you tried. You're all bark and no bite."

"Fuck you!"

When she is alone, she dials Lumina and tells her, "Hey, Lumi, I need a favor. Can you come and help me cheer Adrian up? You heard what happened to him, right?"

"I did, I am coming, baby. I found out the real fabricators of this gas."

"Yea, I also did, it's block B0074."

"What? No, where did you get that from?"

"I followed the stagecoach and it stopped there. Wait. Damn it, I don't actually know if it stopped there to pack it up or to sell more of it."

"It's okay, I know for sure where they make it. It's block B0098. I just bribed the seller of the rainbow gas to go away and tell me their home block."

"Well, how do you know he didn't lie to you to get away from it?"

Awkward silence. "God damn it." Both laugh.

Cut to Adrian playing some turn based rpg on the medical room tv with his controller, blocked from leaving the bed by a forcefield. Lumina tells the doctor, "We want to try to help Adrian's mental state without forcefield."

"Alright, good luck, but don't try nothing nasty."

They walk in and sit down on 2 chairs near Adrian. "Hey. Guys.", says Adrian before pausing the game and putting his controller to the side.

"Howdy! Are the games helping you cope with your affliction? " - opens Kate.

"Um. Sort of? I don't know. Maybe. Also, it's not an affliction, i just saw the truth out there, and now i've made my decision. That world is better than this one. "

"Oh come on, what's so much better about that world than this one?" - asks Lumina.

"Um. Everything. Like, all my dream versions of friends were there and everything was awesome. Nobody was beating the shit out of eachother. "

"But we're here in this world too, and we care about you."

"Uh. You're just saying that to make me feel better, but assuming you're frank with me right now, let's make a suicide pact. "

"What? "

"We can go to the dream world together after death and live there forever. I mean, come on. It'll be sweet and we will all enjoy our afterlife together."

The girls look at eachother in mild shock.

"How do you know you even will go to that world after death, and not to the christian hell or something?"

"Ummmmm. They told me i will."

"Look, think about it. The entities there are dream versions of real world ones or dream amalgamations of real world ones. You are from here, they're from there, they're not the same as the people in this world. When you die in this world, you would go to a dimension of imaginary creatures as a real being, which does not make sense. " - explains Lumina.

"Uh. Wow. That's so much."

"But what if he is seeing everything in the dream from the eyes of his imaginary self, which means after he dies, his manifestation in that world would still there?"

"God fucking damn it, Kate, which side are you on?"

"Wooow. So what you're saying is if i kill myself my dream version will live happily ever after? I can live with that. Or i guess die with that. " He starts laughing. Kate covers her face with hands and starts crying. "See, you're starting to understand too how fucked everything is. "

"Kate, can we talk outside?" They walk outside.

"Look, just stay put. I have an ace up my sleeve."

"What is it? " Kate uncovers her hands and brushes her tears off with a hankerchief.

"You'll see."

Lumina comes back and sits next to Adrian.

"Listen, I have something to tell you. I think you're a great person and I would like to get into a relationship with you."

"Uhhh. Aren't we already friends, sort of?"

"Oh you sweet, innocent child. You don't know what's a relationship, don't you? "

"You're making it sound like I don't, so tell me."

"It's when 2 people love eachother a lot and just keep being sweet to one another, spending time together, helping eachother, you know."

"Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no."

"Why not?"

"You're still trying to cheer me up, right? I don't want to be cheered up. I want to die. If you want to help me, bring me a cup of toilet cleaner so we can get this over with. "

"Stop saying that! I am serious. If you don't want to live for yourself, do it for Kate. Do it for me. Look at how sad she was at the thought of you dying. I am more resistant to sadness, but I still want you around. Come on. I know how to make a person feel loved. And you deserve it."

He turns away from her, sighs and covers his face with one hand. "I can't believe you. I mean, I can, but why me? "

"Because you're the hottest guy on the block and because I think we'll be great together. "

After a delay, he turns to her. "Listen, I need help. I am in a lot of pain. I don't know how much more of this i can take. If someone finds a way to help me, I am down to try. I have no idea how to be in a relationship, so you're gonna have to teach me. I trust that'll be a good substitute for killing myself. "

"Of course it will be! I am here for you. Stay strong. We'll get you through this. " She puts her hand on his.

"Thank you, Lumi."

As she leaves, Kate asks her "Did it work?"

"I think it did. Look, we don't have enough time. Here's the plan, we lock everyone who wants to go to bed today unscathed into the rented rooms for children. Everyone will just sit there until we're allowed to go inside, and then we sit at home and watch the show."

"Watch the show? Come on! We have to save the entire lab from themselves by finding whoever is selling that gas and kicking their ass!"

"Knowing you, you won't leave me alone until I agree, so let's start thinking how are we gonna pull it off."

Cut to Adrian getting another visitor later. It's Victoria. "Why, hello there. Are you feeling alright? "

"Get out of here! I don't have the energy for you."

"Oh, you have the energy. I am here to take more of it away." She pulls a bunch of ice dust from her pocket and throws it at Adrian. He starts screaming in pain. The doctor comes in.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"Oh, it's okay, I was just trying to make him feel better. Nothing crazy." She answered in a different tone.

"She threw ice dust on me!"

"I don't know what you're talking about. I don't see any ice dust. You're definitely delusional." - says Victoria.

"Hey, that's enough. He clearly doesn't want you here. Go, beat it."

"I'll see you around, tough guy." She waves him goodbye as she leaves the room.

Cut to the end of the third lesson.

"And so this is why President Biden would completely annihilate President Putin if two faced off against eachother. To sum it up, Biden Blast is a far superior technique to Putin's Pudding Rain, and in real combat ideological purity and righteousness don't mean much."

"Okay, thank you, \*student name\*. Yes, what is it, Kate?"

"I have an important announcement to make, it's a matter of personal security of a large minority of the class."

"Well, since we're almost at the end, alright."

She walks to the blackboard. "Let's get to it. If you don't plan to consume the rainbow gas today 10 minutes after classes are over, go to the rented room of our block and hide there, only allowing sober people in there and locking the door every time someone isn't coming in or out. I've rented the room out for you in advance until you can return inside. I won't be there because I have business to attend to, but I wish you all luck surviving this afternoon!"

Some students say hooray, some start booing, everyone starts verbally attacking one another.

"You can do that outside, children, you're done with school for today."

Kate walks outside and starts moving away from the block, shows her rocks and her wooden sword, and also puts on a wacky helmet. She arrives to Lumi's block, where 12 armed kids including Lumi are standing in formation. "Hello again, Kate. Now that she's here, here's the plan again: Lighteye will lead us to the block B0098 with the map on his phone. Everyone else is tasked with defending our group from the kids on drugs. Note that this might entirely be an overreaction and nobody is gonna start attacking everyone, however we're still taking out the asshole who started all this. Block 98 is a block of 14 year olds who are taller, faster and stronger than us younger kids, so don't underestimate our threat. Any questions? No? Then let's do this. "

The kids start peacefully walking towards where Lighteye leads them. They see kids in the distance standing with vials, preparing to ingest the gas which turned back from being invisible.

"How much until our destination?"

"We're two thirds of the way there. "

"Alright. I think here they come."

Several crowds of high kids are shown walking around with swords like zombies.

"Surely they're too high to attack us."

2 crowds start closing in on Lumi's group.

"Yep, we're definitely in worst case scenario right now."

Lumi starts blasting people with her laser eyes, but as they keep walking forward, several groups come very close to encircling the group.

"Uh oh."

"Give it up, you vampire scum! We're gonna fill your hearts with steak! Yummy!"

Everyone starts defending themselves. Lumina switches to lightsaber mode and starts attacking the high, but her firepower is insufficient to thin out numbers in time and she is taking mild damage.

"There's too many of them! " says Kate.

"We're fucked! " says someone else.

"Give them the powder, Kate!" says Lumi.

"On it!"

She puts on her gas mask and throws the powdered sleeping gas at the kids. They start choking and falling to the ground.

"We have an opening! Shut your noses and push through! "

The group charges at the opening, with some of the soldiers falling asleep from sleeping gas.

Some of the group, including Lumi and Kate manage to push through and sprint behind a corner where there's relatively no high kids.

"Wow, we're down to 6. I think we lost Lighteye, so Bob, you are now our navigator."

"Yes, ma'am!"

"I don't think i can keep walking anymore, I've got a lot of bruises all over my body. Finish the job, Lumi." - says Kate.

"I will, baby! Thanks for the help!"

After some delay, he says, "I don't think Lighteye was pretty good at his job, he was going the right direction but he made a turn to the wrong side. We have to go a decent amount of blocks that way. "

"Come on, everyone."

They keep heading towards their destination.

"Fuck this, I am out." - some guy in the group says.

"What do you- OH NO!"

The guy pulls out a vial of the gas and chugs it all. Everyone steps away from him, and he starts dancing in a very high way.

More groups of high kids are on the way. When it looks like the group is close to encirclement, one guy in the group says, "Okay, I am about to sacrifice myself. Remember me!"

"No, I am going to sacrifice myself. I get all the glory! "

"Can one of you just let it go and continue? We won't have enough people to take on the 14 year olds!"

They both answer "No!" and pull out vials of sleeping gas and spread them on nearby high kids, attracting their attention and collapsing in the process.

"We're only about 1.5 blocks away. I wonder where all the drunk teens are."

"Yea, where did they all go all of sudden?"

They finally arrive at block 98. It appears empty.

"This better be the block." She starts yelling. "Hey you, the fucker who sold everyone the rainbow gas! Come out and face me!"

She notices the rented building having lights on inside and starts approaching it. As she does, a tall teen in clown like attire comes out.

"Well aren't you a cute little flower."

"Are you the one responsible for today's havoc?" She is clearly annoyed by his remark.

"Yes, I am. What are you going to do about it, little girl?"

"That won't stop me from annihilating you. You think you're tough, don't you? I am here to get you off your high horse and put you in jail. "

"I am not doing this for pride. I did this all to allow everyone to have one night where they go ahead and get high!"

"I am not here to argue with you about the morality of what you're did. I am here to inflict heavy burns on your skin. "

"Try me, bitch."

"I am just gonna stand over here and not get involved." - said Bob.

She starts shooting eye lasers at his eyes to blind him, which he easily blocks with his metallic stick. She starts targeting his arms and legs, he starts combining jumping, dodging and blocking the eye lasers for a bit. When her firerate slows down, he starts exhaling rainbow fumes which quickly expand in volume and start moving towards Lumina. Additionally, he starts throwing vials of gas at her. After finding no way to counter that, she puts on her gas mask and activates her lightsaber. She starts charging at him, but gets lost in the gas cloud. Then he appears out of nowhere and punches her shoulder, knocking her back and on the ground. He goes for a grab, but Lumina rolls out of the way and jumps back up. She notices her lightsaber in his hands, so she deactivates it and activates a second lightsaber she has in her pockets. As she does that, he inhales back all of the rainbow gas around him, puts stolen lightsaber handle of Lumina in his mouth and slowly pulls it out activated with concentrated rainbow gas, creating his own lightsaber.

"Should have fought me at range when you had the chance. Now you're fucked." He charges at her.

"Be careful not to break your arm patting yourself on the back, douchebag." As he starts slashing at her, she sidesteps and thrusts at him, which he parries downwards, to which she slides her sword down to his arm landing a hit. As he tries to land a counterhit, she backsteps.

"Oh no, that almost hurt."

She starts circling around him. She analyzes which attacks he's expecting, and notices a vulnerability, so she makes him think she's going for an attack, but then feints into a crouching slash onto his right knee, causing him to stagger for a moment. When he tries to counterattack, she barely parries the hit and slashes through him, going behind his back.

"That all you got? You have higher odds of breaking out to the outside world than defeating me at this rate." He starts cockily shrugging instead of charging at her.

She realizes he's right, but gets an idea of how to defeat him. She compresses her lightsaber to be shorter, yet brighter.

"Oh yea, a lightdagger? Come on. See what good it does for you."

She starts sprinting around him, looking for an opening, then activates her superspeed and catches an opening to stab the enemy in the back, causing him to make a sound of moderate pain. After that, he spins around and punches her face with his left hook. She staggers for a good while. He swings at her with his lightsaber, she blocks it but is unable to handle the sheer power of her adversary and is knocked to the ground. In a last ditch effort to defeat him, she throws her lightsaber at his chest, at the same time as he bends down to finally slash her. Both attacks land, causing him to stand up and put his left hand on his chest and causing her to also make sounds of moderate pain and start hallucinating. Bob is then seen charging at the enemy from behind and stabs his ass with his wooden sword. As he turns around and prepares to slash through Bob too, Kate is seen crouching not too far away, shooting at the enemy with her pneumatic pistol. (they're sort of expensive)

The first shot lands on his nose, the second on his neck, the third misses, the forth on his forehead, the fifth on his chest, the sixth also misses. The adversary finally collapses in pain and starts groaning.

As Kate waddles closer to Lumina and her adversary, Bob starts calling someone and says, "This is Bob from block B0083. We got the guy who started the rainbow gas epidemic and also assaulted a girl. We're at block B0098, come fast."

Lumina is seen walking like a zombie. She turns to Bob and tells him, "Morning, my servant. You've been chosen as a sacrifice to Narshlab. Come with me."

"Lumi, snap out of it! We did it!" - says Kate.

"Why, hello there, general Yeltsin. How is the project of making beer with the blood of the infants going?"

Cut to Kate and Lumina being carried to their home blocks. Kate calls Adrian on the phone. "Hey. Just called to let you know, we defeated the guy who started all this. He's going to jail for fighting with a girl and inciting a riot. Me and Lumi will receive some cash for this later."

"I am the goddess of all that is silver!" Lumina fires an eye laser into the sky. An adult covers her face with a mask to prevent her eye lasers from accidentally hurting someone.

"Nope, I am heavily bruised and she's high as a kite, probably not intentionally."

"You will bow down to me or I will evaporate you and your family!"

Cut to Adrian lying in bed in the next morning.

The block doctor asks him, "Well, are you feeling any better?"

"Much better. My mood is still in the shitter though. "

"Alright, then I guess we can get you back to classes."

\*sigh\* "Shit."

S1E6 Hungover

Adrian is sitting on a bench alone, watching as most of the other kids are acting much more passive and weird than usual. Then he starts checking the LabSocial posts, which tell what happened in the aftermath of yesterday. A ton of people also had bad trips after the havoc of the early afterclasses, developing depression and other mental disorders they've never had before, as well as sometimes having their mental disorders increase in potency. A lot were and are pissed off at Kate, Lumina and the adults for taking away their rainbow gas. There have been a couple of suicides and suicide attempts, aswell as several people claiming to want to die. It might take a while before things go back to normal.

Suddenly, Lumina comes around and sits next to Adrian, and he puts his phone away when she comes closer.

"Morning. How are you feeling?"

"Better. Still wish this brain fog went away, it hurts."

"Yea, I get what you mean." She takes his hand. "Do you like it when I hold your hand?"

"I love it. Your hand is very soft to touch, and… Yea." He is visibly nervous.

"That's awesome! You know, have you seen how the kids all around the lab feel about what me and Kate did yesterday?"

"M-Mixed. A lot of people say you ruined their fun, but a lot also think you're a hero", he said with noticeable anxiety in his voice.

"That's about right. People are just really stupid and they really don't know what's best for them. Not you, though. You're smart."

"Thank you. I think so are you", he said with even more anxiety in his voice.

"What's wrong? Are you alright?"

Adrian takes a deep breath. "Yes, yes, totally."

"Don't be afraid, handsome. I mean you no harm, and I am here to stay. Go on, tell me what's bothering you. "

"I just realized yesterday after your visit that I am very interested in trying this out with you. I have no idea what am I meant to say to you to guarantee you won't get pissed at me or anything of the sort. You know. "

"Addie, it's okay. Just be honest with me and it'll all work out. I know how to do this, this isn't my first time. We'll figure it all out. " She puts her hand on Adrian's shoulder.

"Thank you. You're the best." He hugs Lumina, and she hugs him back.

They're later seen playing games together and laughing, Adrian launching a small piece of trash in the air and Lumi shooting it with her laser eyes, competing against eachother in drawing (they both end up sucking and laughing about it), making wood sculptures together, chatting with eachother. Eventually Kate comes back and all 3 of them start having fun together by dancing together, walking together, simulating gunslinger duels together (in that particular example, Adrian plays against Kate and Kate wins because she isn't depressed).

Cut to Adrian walking around in circles anxiously outside. Lumi comes around.

"Evening, honey."

"Evening, sweetling. What's wrong?" She puts her hand on his shoulder.

"She's out to get me, you know? She just will not leave me alone until I am dead or in jail. I bet even moving to a different class won't help."

"Who?"

"Victoria. Ever since me and Kate found a way for the boys not to pay for her as a mercenary, she just wants me to suffer more and more. "

"That petty bitch! I will curb stomp her ass straight to the grave and she will feel the coldness of the afterlife for harassing my love. "

"Thank you, beautiful. I'd help but I don't want to piss her off any more than I already did."

"Oh, don't worry. I got her on my own. If your class leader was as weak as he was, then she'll be even more of a pushover."

"I don't know. Good luck, okay?" He takes her hand in both his hands.

"I'll be fine."

"How does she only harass me and not Kate, though? Kate is just as responsible as I am for what we did to her. "

"Well, partially because she has me as a friend, and partially because boys can't legally self-defend against girls which allows girls to harass boys with no direct consequences. However, now that we're together, she's dying tonight. "

"Kick her ass, Lumi. I believe in you."

Cut to Lumina approaching Victoria sitting on the bench and playing something on the phone. "What do you want?"

"I am about to bring holy justice upon you for harassing Adrian. You're gonna be in a hospital for a week. "

"Oh? " Victoria stands up and walks to the side so they have room to fight. "You're distracting me from playing games, so let's get this over with, whatever your name is."

"I am Lumina, the girl who saved the lab from the vicious rainbow gas a while back!"

"Everyone thinks they're real hot shit. " Victoria walks around completely casually and relaxed."Give me your best shot, poser girl."

"That does it!" Lumina starts shooting lasers from her eyes at Victoria. The latter dodges the first and quickly makes an ice shield from an ice ball and starts blocking the lasers. Lumi tries to hit different parts of her body, but Victoria easily moves the shield around to block them and starts whistling at some point as a form of taunting.

Lumina activates her sword and charges at Victoria. The latter puts her shield to the side a little and blasts Lumina with the shattered ice ball shotgun spell, catching her off guard and making her step back a decent distance, as well as produce sounds of pain.

"You can't defeat me at range, you can't defeat me point blank. Stop wasting my time and leave me alone. "

Lumina brushes off some icicles stuck to her clothes and starts circling around her, activating superspeed. She's trying to approach Victoria from the back to stab her like that other guy, but Victoria readies a big ball of ice and launches it in the air and shatters it in a specific pattern so that ice shards hit a decent circle around Victoria. As Lumi goes for the attack, a bunch of ice shards hit her in the neck, with some falling through her shirt, causing her to fall to the ground, screaming in pain. Victoria turns around, and gets down on her knees, and tells her defeated opponent, "If you haven't learnt your lesson, next time I will shove a few cups of ice dust down your clothes. Trust me, what you're feeling right now is nothing compared to what I can do. "

As she stands up, she notices Kate behind her loading her pistol. "You want some too or am I not gonna have to start turning your life into a horror game, just like Adrian's?"

Kate puts her gun inside one of her pockets and raises her hands up a little, but not all the way, and starts approaching Lumina and Victoria.

"Good. At least you have a brain inside your skull."

As she walks away, Kate comes to Lumi, sits on her knees and puts her hand on her.

"Holy fuck, Lumi, are you okay?"

"Sort of. She's a monster, Kate. I bet she didn't even use all she had on me."

"Why would you attack her? You know she's strong."

"Didn't think she was stronger than a 14 year old with powers. That absolute disgusting, sociopathic, cold, ugly, flat, annoying, cynical bitch, I will have my revenge on her if it's the last fucking thing I do!" She starts getting up.

"It's okay, baby. Try not to think about her, okay?"

"Alright, alright. Let's get out of here."

Adrian is seen watching some parody of a cartoon at his home. Lumi arrives with several tears in her clothes, as well as small marks from the ice shards on her face.

"Are you okay, sweetie? Did you win?" He stands up.

"No! Who does that entitled cunt think she is? She also had the guts to tell me she doesn't remember who I am after I saved the lab! What a bitch!" She's anxiously walking in circles.

"It's okay, I'll endure her somehow."

"It's not! She thinks she's better than everyone else, oh what wouldn't I give to teach her a lesson!"

"Sweetie, you asked me to always be honest with you, and I honestly think that you're not thinking rationally right now. You sound enraged. " He puts his hand on her shoulder.

"You're right, you're right." She somewhat calms down and sits down on Adrian's bed with him and starts making signs with her hands. "What we need to do is cook up all possible plans for how to get our revenge on her, then execute them all one by one until she is put in her place."

"You know we can just ignore her, right?"

"I think I already have a few ideas. The first one I'd like to try is have one of my classmates befriend her and start slowly sabotaging her life in a way so they don't get caught until she hates her life as much as you did when after the bad trip you had. I've got a couple more drastic ones in stock if that doesn't work. "

"Well I certainly can't help you with the first one, I am gonna have to sit back, watch and hope you'll succeed. "

"Thanks for having my back, Addie. She'll pay for everything."

Next day, she is seen briefing a girl in her class.

"Listen, the reason why I called you here is because I have a task for you. Your job is to infiltrate a specific person from block B0085 called Victoria by pretending to become her friend. She's antisocial and extremely dangerous, so be careful not to piss her off."

"I don't know, Lumina, that sounds manipulative and honestly sort of obsessive. What do you plan to do, anyway?"

"Oh, I know it seems that way when i put it like that out of context, but she is actually a very sadistic, vindictive and overall horrible person who likes to bully people for fun. She cannot be allowed to do whatever she wants. You'd be doing everyone a favor gaining leverage over her."

"Yea, I get where you're coming from. I am on it! "

Cut to Adrian sitting on a bench minding his own business, then he hears, then sees the girl crying and walking somewhere with her face covered with her hands. Adrian notices her, stands up and comes close, and tells her, "Hey, I am Adrian. If you're with Lumi, can you please come around the corner with me?"

They sit down on a bench together.

"Yes?"

"Why are you crying?"

"I did as Lumina asked me to. I sat down near Victoria and started trying to talk to her. She was answering me dismissively and doing something on her phone the whole time. When I asked her if there was a reason she didn't wanna talk and asked her to open up to me, she said, "Alright, let me open up to you about something", then she put her hand which was cold as death itself on my back! It hurts so much! I've never felt this much pain before!"

"It's alright, you won't have to see her again. Did anything happen after that?"

"She told me that she doesn't appreciate being distracted from her usual day to day business and told me to get lost."

"Oh man, what a lady. Thank you so much for your help."

Cut to Lumina talking with some 14 year old girls.

"So basically, I need a favor. One of you will invite this girl I know from block 85 right here supposedly for a job. Promise her a lot of money in the letter, like 300 tokens should be perfect. Then when she comes around, throw a bunch of nets at her until she completely can't move, and beat the living shit out of her. I am talking about a near death beating, a beating so severe she starts walking around like a 90 year old lady and every muscle movement hurts like hell afterwards for her whole life. As long as her essential bones are broken. Can you do that for me?"

"Well, we can absolutely do that. I can imagine a hero like you wouldn't just do something like that to someone out of jealousy or insecurity so she's probably a terrible person."

"Exactly!"

"Then we'll do it tomorrow after classes."

Cut to Victoria receiving and opening a letter from a 14 year old dude.

Cut to Lumina and Adrian walking to block 98.

"Can't wait to hear her delightful screams of agony! Mmm!"

"Lumi… Nevermind. "

"What?"

"Don't worry about it. Let's see how well block 98 handled a single 10 year old girl."

As they walk where the playground of block 98 is visible, they both look shocked. "Oh my GOD."

The camera turns towards a playground with a bunch of nets lying around and several teenage girls lying on the ground, crying and screaming from pain. As Lumi and Adrian come closer, Lumi asks the girls:

"Did she manage to break free? What went wrong?"

"Oh, sweetie, you don't understand! As soon as we circled her and threw our nets at her, she grabbed Natali with her full body, and she received so much cold that she is now knocked out from pain. All the nets completely missed, we tried to kick her ass anyway, but she unleashed several spreads of ice shards on us before we could get close! What kind of a monster is that girl??"

Lumina is seen lying on her bed staring upwards in despair. Adrian arrives and sits on a chair next to her.

"You alright, sweetie?"

"No. I am powerless. There's no hope for us to do anything about her. She is unbelievably strong, unbelievably annoying, and unbelievably horrible all around. "

"Look. You don't have to chase revenge all your life to have any fun in life. You always have me and my love to support you. "

"Well at least you don't think i am worthless."

"Of course, nobody thinks that. You're a wonderful human being and you've done so much for me. Seriously, she isn't worth your headspace."

"Yea, you're right, I just really don't know why did i go through such lengths anyway. I love you so much." She sits down and signals Adrian to sit next to her. They do a long lip kiss together and the episode ends.

S1E7 Crime and Reinforcement

\*rewrite it so a shitty rule change causes the disaster to happen instead of the girls entirely on their own\*

Mike comes to Adrian and tells him, "Hey Adrian, I got a job for you. It's basically free 10 tokens. Interested?"

"Let's hear it."

"I need you to go on LabSocial and write how much you hate girls, even if you don't. You'll get a bonus of 5 tokens if what you write is especially vile or gross."

"Mike, what the actual fuck? Why would you pay someone to flame girls on social media?"

"Because they're entitled bitches and they think they're better than us. We need to teach them a lesson. Come on, everyone's doing it."

"Get outta here."

"The offer still stands!"

Adrian calls Kate on the phone.

"What's up?"

"We have a problem. I've just been offered pretty decent cash to flame girls on LabSocial by Mike. "

"Mike? Why would that son of a bitch do something like that?"

"No idea. Anyway, what do you say we question him together?"

Silence. "Kate? AAAH DON'T HURT ME I AM SORRY!" A hand touches his shoulder from behind, and he dashes forward and turns around and notices it was Kate. She starts giggling.

"Ah for fuck's sake, dude. I wasn't paying attention to psychic energy around me." He ends the call and puts his phone away.

\*giggles\* "The look on your face!"

"Okay, that was sorta funny. Thought it was Victoria for some reason."

\*starts giggling less\* "Oh shit, okay that's just disturbing. Anyway, any ideas how do we threaten him? I mean what if the threat of kicking him in the balls a few times wouldn't work?"

"Well, we can ask Nathan to help us. Speaking of Victoria, we can absolutely buy an ice cube from her or something, that will definitely make him spill his guts. "

"You sound like you'd prefer not to try out that option."

"Nope, I've had enough Victoria for now."

"Then let's go ask Nathan."

They walk up to him. "Hey, we need some help. Mike's paying everyone to flame girls on LabSocial. Can you help us extract what he knows from him?"

"Oh come on, you goodie two shoes, no pun intended. They're basically giving away free money! I even got permission from my girlfriend to accept the deal. It's nothing to worry about. "

"God damn it, he's been compromised! Let's get out of here", said Kate.

After they walk away, Kate says, "What if Lumi can help us? "

"Worth a shot."

Kate calls her. "Shit, unavailable. Well, whatever, I have a plan D. Let me brief you on it."

Cut to Adrian approaching Mike. "Hey, can I talk to you for a sec a bit away from here? "

"Yea, sure, is this about the deal?"

"That's right, but let's not start discussing it before it's too early. "

They walk a bit away from everyone, then Kate creeps behind him and grabs Mike's throat with her entire arm. Adrian pulls out his sword.

"Why are you actually paying people to flame girls? "

"I told you, they're bitches, they want the world to be theirs!"

"Bullshit. You're making shit up as you go. Adrian, smack him a few times. "

Adrian smacks him a few times.

"I swear, I don't know anything! I mean that's it, i told you everything!"

"You're a terrible liar, Mike. Give him hell, Addie. " - says Kate.

He sheathes his sword, pulls out his phone, connects headphones to it, puts them into Mike's ears, and loud cat music starts playing.

"I have no idea what you're talking about. Please. I can't tell you because I don't know. Stop! "

"Activate plan D. " - signals Kate.

Adrian puts his phone back in his pocket, and pulls out Kate's pneumatic pistol and aims it at Mike's balls.

"Sweet Jesus! Why the balls?"

"This pistol is fully loaded, and I will shoot your balls over and over until you finally talk."

"Look, they're gonna beat the shit out of me if i do?"

"And if you don't, we will, so start talking about who are they."

"Class B0080! They have this redhead guy in charge of the class who paid me to do this, and told me if i talk, my ass will be kicked to the ground! "

"Are we good, Kate?"

"Yea, my hand was getting tired. Come on, beat it." Mike runs away.

Lisa in the distance was watching the whole thing. She takes her phone and types somewhere, "Mike from block 85 has been compromised. I repeat, Mike from block 85 has been compromised."

Adrian and Kate walk to block B0080 with their swords drawn and their helmets on. They see the redhead guy standing with arms behind his back and staring at them, with his classmates standing some distance behind him. "Welcome, gentlemen. How can I help you? "

"Cut the crap. You're standing here and staring at us like you have nothing better to do. Why are you doing this? "

"My girlfriend pissed me off so I've decided to put all girls in their place through passive resistance and making them feel hated by us boys. Is that so bad?"

"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. How about the truth?"

"Come closer, and I'll tell you."

They come closer. Suddenly, Adrian grabs his head with his free hand. "Ahh! The brain fog is attacking again like never before! Why now? Why now? "

Kate charges the redhead. Midway through, she starts weeping, drops her sword and falls on her knees.

"You really should have done any research into who I am. I can see that you have powers, which helped you resist mine, but you are still depressed, so it didn't take too much focus to break you. She, however, doesn't have any powers, and on top of that, she seems to have a hypersensitive mood, which caused her to go from perfectly content and focused to extremely sad and defeated in a matter of moments. I highly advise you to let this go, lest you want more pain inflicted on you. Farewell. "

He turns around and his entire block claps for him. Adrian picks Kate up from her knees and starts leading her to their home block.

"How badly are you feeling?"

No response.

"Oh jeez."

Cut to the next class where Kate is continuing to cry. The teacher asks her, "Kate, what's wrong?"

Silence.

"Kate, you can't keep crying all day. Tell us what's wrong so we can help you."

Silence.

"Adrian, what the fuck is up with her? "

"Um. No idea", he shrugs. Kate starts crying louder.

"I know you two bullied Mike together for some time, then you went for a walk somewhere and she came back with you like this! Tell us what you know!" - some girl in class asked.

"Damn it. Fine. But let me come to the blackboard so i can explain the full context."

"Go ahead, and hurry up."

He walks to the blackboard. Kate starts crying quieter.

"We, uh, have another crisis on our hands. Yea, I know we had the rainbow gas epidemic, that mini war against the lightning kid, my girlfriend's friends using generative AI to attack seemingly everyone, but yep, there's more where that came from. Mike has been paid to pay people to spread hatred towards girls on LabSocial. " Kate stops making crying sounds.

"That's horrible! How dare they!" - Lisa says.

"Uhm, Lisa, you literally consented to me accepting the deal." - says Nathan.

"But I didn't pay attention to what the deal actually was! "

"Continuing on, we tracked the people who paid Mike to some redhead from block 80. He was notified about mine and Kate's arrival, so he was waiting for us. He told us some obvious lie about why was he doing this, we didn't accept it, he dared us to come closer, we did, he somehow made my brain fog come out stronger than ever and made her cry non stop. Oh wow, she's crying quietly now. Anyway, we need unite together today after classes and assault block 80. "

"Yea!" - said everyone.

"Okay, children, that's enough of that. Let's get back to the lesson."

As Adrian walks out of the class, he gets a call from Lumina. "Babe, we have a problem."

"Yea, the boys flaming girls, I know."

"Do you know why are they doing this, though?"

"No idea. We only know that the redhead kid from block 80 is responsible for this."

"Yea, his name is Vasiliy. He is being paid and manipulated by the Interblockial Council of Girls to do this so the girls have a casus belli to start indiscriminately attacking boys. "

"Holy fuck Lumi, what are you smoking? Also, wow, what an awkward name."

"Wasn't my idea. I am on the ICG, they discussed this directly. They want to exploit laws that disallow self defence against female aggression for boys to extract all the concessions they want from the boys. Victoria is in there aswell, she's been promised a hefty sum for her participation. "

"If you're right, then it's bad. Most of our class is currently preparing to march on block 80 to kick their asses, including the girls. "

"Are you serious? You guys are marching straight into a deathtrap! Come on, we have to stop them. Who's leading the assault?"

Adrian makes an awkward face. "Nathan."

"I am coming to your block so we can talk him into canceling this whole thing."

Cut to Adrian, Lumi and Nathan standing in a quiet place. "So to sum it up, our block is about to march into a deathtrap during which most of the girls will probably violently turn against the boys. " - explains Lumina.

"Shit. You better not be manipulating me or something."

"I WOULD NEVER MANIPULATE ANYONE FUCK YOU! "

"It's okay, Lumi. Jeez. " - says Adrian.

Cut to Lumina giving a speech with Nathan and Adrian standing beside her.

"So after we arrive there, the girls will activate and start attacking every last guy. Both in our block and the block you're about to invade."

"Are you really gonna stand there and listen to this bullshit?" - says Victoria and walks in front of the crowd.

"Victoria?" The allied trio is staring at her in shock, preparing to fight or flight.

"Lumina is an internalized misogynist and she just wants us girls to accept that we're inferior to the boys. We're not, and now that we're about to show the king mysogynist the what for, she has manipulated her partner and our leader to cancel the whole thing." Lumina blasts her with her laser, but Victoria quickly blocks them with an ice buckler she made right on the spot. "You see? She is completely unable to handle a civil conversation and she instantly attacked me because I was saying the truth." Lumina continues to visibly fume. "Don't let yourselves get manipulated aswell, guys and gals. Let's go blast these 80's to oblivion! "

Everyone cheers for her. Lumina finally snaps.

"That's it! You're not going anywhere! Me and Nathan will kick your lying ass! "

Nathan looks around quickly and shortly after says, "Y-Yea!" with no confidence in his voice.

"Well isn't this dandy. Everyone, march on towards block 80. I will deal with the liars." Adrian walks back and sits on the ground to watch the fight, knowing that he will be unable to pull any weight with his miniscule powers of psychic energy detection. Several other spectators pull out their phones and start recording the battle. Lumina and Nathan start circling around Victoria to make it harder for her to defend herself. She throws an ice ball grenade on Nathan's path, but he manages to quickly pull out his sword and reflect the grenade, making it land between him and Victoria and hit nobody. Lumi gets in position and starts firing eye lasers at Victoria, who quickly starts turning an ice ball into a shield and starts blocking the lasers even before the shield was finished forming. At the same time, Nathan starts launching fireballs at Victoria, who makes another shield from an ice ball and starts blocking the fireballs. She also walks away from both of her opponents to avoid being jammed between them, but they move the same way with her. Lumina realizes in her head that the reason why Victoria is able to block all the projectiles is because her own and Nathan's projectiles are out of sync, so she starts timing her eye laser shots with Nathan's fireball launches. Victoria continues to block the projectiles like nothing happened, until a fireball hits her in the cheek and deals no damage. Nathan and Lumi pause shooting at her for a moment in shock.

"Wow. I knew you were more bark than bite, Nathan, but Jesus Christ, you might just be the weakest caster in the lab." - says Victoria.

"She's so right, we're fucked." - whispers Lumina.

Nathan starts shooting a lot more fireballs. Victoria shrinks her ice shield on the side of Nathan back into a ball of ice and blocks every fireball with the top of her bare hands.

"You really need to sit next to Adrian over there, Mr. Overcompensation."

Nathan gets pissed. He starts casting a bigger fireball, Victoria turns the ball in her hand on Nathan's side into a small buckler. Nathan's big fireball starts to get very big. Victoria starts walking towards Nathan and he releases the big fireball at her. Lumina starts shooting eye lasers again. Victoria blocks all the eye lasers with the shield in her Lumina side hand and at the same time she deflects the big fireball with her small buckler, shattering both the buckler and the fireball and staggering Victoria for a moment. Right after she recovers, she launches the shattering ice ball at Nathan. He protects his eyes with his left arm, but gets staggered. At the same time Lumina activates her lightsaber, then her super speed and starts dashing erratically before launching a thrust at Victoria, which she ducks at the last moment, causing Lumina to trip and fall to the ground. Victoria throws her shield and shatters it mid air like she did with ice balls, but this time at Lumina, and steps away from both Nathan and Lumi. As this all was happening, Nathan was casting another fireball, this time less large yet still larger than his initial ones, and then he launches the fireball at Victoria's knees. This time, she tries kicking it with her shoes to reflect it back at Nathan and Lumina, which partially works, causing the fireball to break apart, with its pieces covering Lumina lying on the ground.

"Still think you two are hot shit?"

They both start rapidfiring projectiles at her and Lumina starts slowly getting up. At the same time, Victoria uses 2 ice balls to create a really large shield to block all the projectiles, then pulls out another ice ball from her pockets and throws it like a grenade at Lumina as she is halfway through standing up, which causes her to fall down again and start groaning in pain. Nathan notices this and tries to turn around and start sprinting away, to which Victoria starts sprinting at him, launches her big shield at him and shatters it midair into pieces, causing Nathan to fall facedown into the ground. As he tries to stand up, she presses him back to the ground with her cold hand, pulls out yet another ice ball out of her pockets, shatters it within her right hand, and pours the ice dust behind his shirt, causing him to scream from pain.

"You have better chances of succeeding in literally anything by yourself than your chances of defeating me."

"Okay,okay, stop, it hurts!"

She gets the ice dust off from his skin and brushes it to the side, then returns to holding his shoulder to prevent him from standing up.

"Let's make one thing clear. From this day on, I am the real leader of the block. Me. You will still handle all the day to day duties and be the public face and everything, but both you and all of our class will obey my command if I demand you to. Got it?"

"Got it, we have a deal."

Victoria silently stands up and walks away.

Camera shows block 80 where girls keep chasing boys and beating the shit out of them. When one of them pushes one of the girls back, someone snaps it with their phone and calls the local teacher, and the boy gets grabbed and dragged inside.

Back to block 85, Kate walks to Lumina. As Adrian starts coming close, he notices Victoria walking within shattering ice ball range from him and gets startled.

"You're not worth the ice. Keep going and admiring my work", she said filled with pride and sass.

Kate gets on her knees to talk to fallen Lumina.

"You alright? I've never seen anyone actually get hit by the epicenter of an ice ball grenade explosion."

"Ughhhh… I've had worse. Well, barely. "

"This is Adrian from block B0085. We got Lumina from block B0083 grievously injured and unable to move." He sits down, puts away his phone and starts petting her. "You fought well, babe. "

"Not… really. But thanks. Love."

Cut to the next day, in class.

"We have received a record number of injured children yesterday. Turns out, reports of Lumina from block B0083 were absolutely correct and a lot of girls all over the lab were plotting to beat the shit out of every boy they see to extract concessions from them. It was a clear exploitation of our laws protecting women, which we have fixed overnight by declaring it legal to attack a girl in self defence, while still keeping it illegal to attack girls without a casus beli. All the boys punished for breaking the old rule were pardoned. While we couldn't punish all the girls who abused the old rules, you should be ashamed of yourselves. "

Most boys in class are shown to have a lot of bruises and bandaids. "Also, Victoria, you're a bitch for extorting the entire class for a ton of tokens."

"Sorry, Mr. Teacher, but I can't hear you behind my massive goddamn paycheck. What was that again?"

S1E8 Day Off

Lumina, Kate and Adrian are laughing together while sitting in Adrian's room.

"So how did he like being presented with a box wrapped with a pretty bow that had a mountain of poo inside?" - asked Kate.

"Well, he got pissed off and it started a war that lasted about a week."

"Why doesn't that surprise me one bit?" - said Lumina.

"Huh, I wonder why? " - he answered in a goofy accent. Everyone laughed.

"Have I ever told you the story of how the two of us met?" - asks Lumina.

"Nope. Continue."

"Well, me and a deadbeat former friend of mine Jason were having just a casual sunday evening around 1.5 years ago… "

Cut to younger Jason and Lumina sitting at a desk inside one of their rooms, looking at the map of the lab, planning how they would acquire several hundreds of kilograms of any metal.

"These guys have bats made of tin. It would be easy to challenge them to a battle and steal all their weapons as loot. " - says Lumi.

"Yea, that should put us one step closer to our target. Don't you think our statue of a giant dookie will be a legendary relic for centuries to come?"

"Oh how I love thinking about it."

Jason gets a new message and reads it. "Huh. Some kid is starting a new religion that wants to bring peace to the whole world. "

"Jesus, I am about to die of cringe. How dumb are people?"

"Now, now, Lumi, don't be so prejudiced. You know the history of how the church of the spaghetti monster was initially thought to be a joke?"

"Yea, and then the monster got genetically engineered to be a real creature and now a sizable minority of sentient robots that overtook North America worship it as a deity. You're right, what if these loons are actually right. "

A few days later, the block 83 army is marching somewhere, until they encounter another, smaller group of people marching somewhere, dressed in funny clothes.

"Who the fuck are you weirdoes?" - asks them Lumina.

"Lumi, that's not a very charismatic greeting to a new faction, we don't wanna get on their bad side. Anyway, gentlemen, what are the plans for the evening?" - says Jason.

"We are the Army of Peace. We march around and we aim to bring peace to the lab by punishing anyone who violates the lab's serenity. "

"Are you melvins actually for real? You know that ever since the lab was open for us, everyone was at war with everyone else?"

"Very observant, good sir, and we're trying to solve that. For it is unwise for children of our ages to fight eachother and get scars instead of doing more normal things like learning new skills or playing games. So where are you heading?"

"We're marching on a certain block with the intention of defeating them with our superior might! We won't tell you why. "

"We want their metal! "

"Damn it, Kevin, will you ever learn when it's an appropriate place to speak?"

"Very well. We'll be going on our way. Enjoy the silly childish wars, while you still can."

Lumina sprints out in front and blasts an eye laser at the head of the guy who said that. "Stop annoying us and get outta here! We're tired of listening to your zealot bullshit!"

Jason gently grabs her by the shoulders. "Careful, I don't know if we want to take our chances pissing them off. They could be a part of a greater faction."

Cut to the actual battle for the metal. It went smoothly, thanks to Lumina's eye lasers and Jason's ability to pull the body of a blooded creature in any direction, rendering them nearly unable to do anything.

In the evening, Lumina asks her dad, "Dad, have you heard of the Army of Peace that aims to bring peace to the lab by bullying any interblock warfare? Can they even do that?"

"I haven't heard of them, darling. However, it sounds like they're not breaking any rules of juvenile warfare."

"Ugh. I really hope they won't get horribly strong or anything. "

The next day, the army of the block 83 suddenly severely decreased in numbers.

"Why is there less of us all of a sudden?" - asks Jason.

"Well I know Arthur has joined the army of piece last evening. "

"That bastard! Thank you, soldier." - says Lumina.

"It seems like we are facing a crisis that could end our way of life as we know it. You are hereby ordered to look through nearby blocks to see if there is anyone else who resists the Army of Peace. We will triumph over their bodies!" Claps are heard.

"And that's when we found eachother! I was also looking for allies in the fight against the boring cringelords." - says present day Kate.

Cut to Lumina returning from her diplomatic trip around the lab to find a new tough looking girl named Kate sitting on a bench. They approach eachother.

"Can I help you?"

"Sister, I would like to ask you the same question. I heard you pissed off the Army of Peace big time and I know a way how we can work together to return the orderly discord to the lab."

"Oh yea? Let's get to the side a little so we can talk in private. "

Cut to them standing away from people and talking.

"So basically, we have a massive part of our class not believing it's a big deal, with some even going further as to join the enemy. However, our leader is on board and in theory we could join forces to have your block do a pretend invasion on ours. We will pretend like we're fighting to lure out the Army of Peace, and then we both stop pretend fighting and attack the army, then we find where their leader is and kick his ass together. What do you think?"

"Wow, it's perfect! Give me the name of your class leader and I'll dm him and discuss this plan. "

They fistbump.

"Oh that's what happened. Damn, good cooking, Kate." - says present day Adrian.

She gives him a thumbs up.

"Wait, hold on, why don't you know that whole ordeal went? Unless…" - asks Lumi.

"Yea, I am afraid I was in the Army of Peace."

"But why would you join in on that? Don't you love fighting or watching people fight? You have powers, dude. One day they'll activate and you'll become just like me or Jason. "

"Yea, I know. I just felt disillusioned with everything and everyone at the time and I wanted something to change. But that whole situation has taught me to just shut up and roll with it."

"Adrian, while I would normally disagree with you that you should do nothing while the world around you burns, joining these losers was absolutely a mistake. Not because they lost, but because fighting is all we know and if you won, we would either feel chained to be unable to vent out our frustrations in life on others or the adults would come in and stop you because they want us to fight all our childhoods so by the time we reach the battlefield we'd know where's up or down. " - said Kate.

"Yea. Anyway, where were we?"

Cut to the actual plan going into motion. The two blocks are having a fake fight for a few tens of minutes, until the Army of Peace arrives and starts assaulting the attackers. A horn is heard, and block 85 goes to the sides of the Army and starts attacking them aswell. The Army of Peace ended up way stronger than initially thought to be: the allied forces were about 1.5 times the strength of a united block, the Army was stronger than that by a third. However, thanks to the element of surprise and a superior number of kids with powers for the allies, the Army has been defeated. It didn't take too long for the defeated kids to squeal about the location of the Army base. As it turned out, the leader was just a powerless kid, who got quickly coerced by Kate and Lumina into disbanding the Army.

"Wow, awesome!" - said present day Adrian.

"It was, and we were sometimes hanging together when my other friends got too lame."

"Aww." - said Kate.

"Now that I think about it. What exactly went wrong in your second round against Victoria?"

"Adrian, why…" - says Kate.

"Ugh. Fine, let me explain. You know how she has this nasty shattering ice ball attack which deals devastating damage at close range?"

"Yep."

"Neither of us could approach her. We didn't have the defensive capabilities to withstand her ice shards, so we kept trying to jam her between us, and I got the idea to synchronize my shots with Nathan's. And then he finally casted a fireball strong enough to break her guard. She could have dodged it, but A) it could hit me, and B) she's an annoying cocky bitch that likes to flex on people. But she didn't, and when it turned out to be slightly stronger than she thought, I thought that was a good enough opening to close the distance with my super speed dashes. However, when using that ability, my mind doesn't actually become faster, only my body does, and I have to plan my movements ahead to succeed. She must have expected an attack and dodged it. However, stupidly enough, I was putting my all into it, and when it missed, I was knocked to the ground because I didn't expect that outcome. From there I was very vulnerable to her counterattack, and fucking Nathan casted a fireball which she somehow managed to reflect with only her feet, and at that point the battle was already over. He wouldn't have stood a chance without me."

"Damn. I wonder if you could have won if you worn some better armor. "

"I mean, where would I get the armor sufficient enough to withstand these ice shards? The standard clothes we have are synthetic and garbage as defense. Oh, but I know! We can make some plate armor from the metal scraps from the giant dookie project so I can-"

"Lumi, stop. Seriously, you're out of control." - Kate said worryingly.

"What?" - Lumi answered as if she was just insulted.

"It hasn't even been a week since Victoria absolutely destroyed both you and Nathan. "

"Like I said, my defense stemmed from just one mistake which won't happen again. If we get around 10 warriors with shields, Nathan and myself, we got her for sure." She's starting to sound angry.

"Lumi, you're obsessed. She'll probably find a way to defeat you that way aswell, she could defeat the entire lab on her own for all we know! Please, don't make your life all about kicking her ass, it's not worth it. "

"SHUT UP! I WILL KICK HER ASS EVEN IF THE PREPARATION WILL TAKE ME A CENTURY! DON'T TRY TO STOP ME, YOU FUCKING CUNT!"

Adrian moves back a little in shock. Kate is shocked too.

"What happened to you? You never yelled at me before. Seriously, your hyperfixation on Victoria is changing you. " She puts her hands on Lumi's shoulders.

"GET AWAY FROM ME! I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO FINISH THE JOB! I am going to start working on my new armor set. Are you with me, Addie?"

Silence. Both girls stare at Adrian, and he alternates between staring at both of them. Eventually Lumina gets tired of waiting and says "WELL FUCK YOU TOO!".

"Wowza."

"Why did you have to bring up Victoria again? We agreed to not remind Lumi of her. "

"I was really curious. I didn't think she really is that volatile."

"Can't blame you. She really didn't used to be like this."

"I feel like even her psychic energy readings have changed. Like, they've gotten more aggressive."

"That word again, what are you talking about?"

"Well, you know how I have powers, right?"

"No. Wait, do I?"

"Either way. If I focus just a little, I can see weird little traces of living humans around me, with some exceptions. From what I've been told by my parents, these are psychic energy readings that my special brain is detecting."

"Wow, but also damn, that's gotta be the least useful power to have because we're not allowed to play at nighttime and we can take our stuff to our rooms where they're completely safe from any intruders."

"I know, right? There's also this weird aspect that I can't sense my parents' psychic energy readings. When I asked my parents about why, they told me they have some sort of cybernetic enhancements to prevent them from emitting any psychic energy. "

"Why would they need that? "

"No idea, I asked them the same question but they told me they can't answer it. Oh, I just remembered, I can actually use this power to tell if there's someone behind me, but, again, I can only do it if I am slightly focused on my surroundings, so when you approached me from behind that one time, I didn't notice you."

"Oh that makes sense! Well I guess your power does have an actual, if niche, use!"

"Yep, I suppose I do!"

Cut to Lumina working her ass off to make a suit of plate armor with her classmates. Eventually she is done, and she dons her shitty plate armor and a ptotective visor and starts walking to block 85 to challenge Victoria, and dms Kate and Adrian to come watch. When she approaches Victoria's corner, she yells "VICTORIA!"

"You fucking serious right now?"

Instead of an answer, Lumina blasts Victoria with her laser eyes. She blocks the laser eyes like usual with her ice shield, and approaches Lumina. After noticing her intentions, instead of backing away, Lumina activates her laser sword to prepare for close range combat and starts approaching Victoria in turn. She blasts her with a shattering ice ball, as anticipated, and the ice shards manage to penetrate some unprotected parts of Lumina's clothes, but most of them bounce off. She tries another 2 shattering ice ball blasts, which staggers Lumina a little, but overall she remains on her feet. Lumina dashes to the melee range and slashes at Victoria, who promptly deflects the attack by forming an ice shield while the swing is ongoing, leading Lumina to drop her lightsaber and almost lose her balance. Victoria then uses that opportunity to grab Lumina's face in her hands.

"I see you're stubborn and aren't so easily dissuaded by the burning sensation of my icy hands. Maybe this will make you finally leave me alone. Walk."

She grabs Lumina by the neck, and leads her to her to where Victoria spends all her school breaks. She then puts her against a wall and throws some ice dust inside her shirt to preveng her from moving, and pulls out a big bottle of water from underneath her bench. She grabs an ice ball from her pockets, puts it on the bench and starts pouring water onto the ball to gradually make it as big as possible. After that's done, she positions Lumina to sit against a wall with her knees bent over, and turns the ice ball into a giant ice bubble to imprison Lumina inside of. At this point Lumina is in way too much pain to be able to break free. Victoria sits down and starts chatting on her phone like nothing happened. When Adrian and Kate approach her and the ice bubble, she quickly pulls out an ice ball with her left hand and tells them "You want some too, dickfaces?"

A montage shows Lumina banging against the walls of the ice bubble for the rest of the day, eventually giving up, while Victoria keeps sitting in her phone and doing something without losing focus. Eventually everyone is ordered to go to their homes, so Victoria puts away her phone, and converts the ice bubble back into a giant ball of ice and puts it under her bench. As she is doing this, she tells Lumina, "If you didn't learn your lesson, next time your friends will share the jail with you. See you around", to which Lumina stands up and walks away. Adrian and Kate come to her and hug her.

"Lumi, you're back!"

"Holy shit, sweetie, are you okay?"

"That was the worst pain i've ever experienced in my life."

"It's okay, baby, we're here for you!"

"Yea, thanks for keeping me entertained all this time, you guys. I don't wanna think how horrible it would have been without your help."

"Soo, are you planning anything for the next battle?"

"The problem is, she said next time, you guys will be joining me too. Do you know what this means? It means I need to have the most perfect and infallible plan there is next time I try this out. " This visibly shocks Adrian and Kate starts pounding herself on the face with her fist.

S1E9 The Meltdown

Lumina and Adrian are standing outside and trying to have a conversation.

"But I have no idea what's gone into you! You barely show affection to me anymore, and all you seem to be caring about is vengeance on Victoria and it makes me highly upset. I've got enough problems from rainbow gas induced depression already, you know. "

"Don't you realize that I am trying to protect us all from her bullying? She is a monster and she feels entitled to do whatever she wants! Why can't you understand that with her around, we can't live a good life?"

"She will put me and Kate with you in an ice bubble after the next rematch! You know how horrible it was down there, it's honestly a miracle you didn't completely get turned into a popsickle! Are you really willing to risk my well-being to exact revenge on her when we can just avoid her?"

"We can't avoid her, she's a mercenary, all it takes is for someone to give her just a bit of tokens and she will curb stomp our asses into the ground yet again!"

"So we stay away from her and bribe her if she ever attacks us again, what's the big deal?"

"Jesus Christ, Adrian, how fucking worthless are you? Are you seriously gonna let her step all over yourself like that? Have some pride, you fucking worm!"

Adrian covers his face with hands. Kate comes around. "Hey guys. Why do you look like someone mentioned Victoria again and why does he have his face covered?"

"He just won't understand why revenge on Victoria is our top priority and how nothing else is more important than that!"

"Kate, please pull out your gun and empty a clip into my head. I don't wanna listen to her anymore. Please, spare me from this pain. I beg you." - said Adrian in a highly distressed voice.

"Addie, I will not. Also, holy fuck, what have you done to him, Lumi?"

She shrugs.

"Look, Addie, everything is gonna be okay. I think you need some silence to decompress. I'll check on you later."

"Alright, see you guys."

"Man, why does every relationship I witness always resorts to this?" - Kate starts pondering.

"I don't know. I will protect him no matter what, even if he doesn't want it."

"And you don't see anything wrong with that mentality?"

"No?"

"Alright, fuck this convo. The reason why I came here is because I've received messages about a certain class finding a way to exploit their local doctor to acquire itching powder, which was then mixed with water to create an itching liquid which has been used in warfare between blocks as a very effective chemical weapon. "

"Wow, cool! I wonder if it's just what I need to defeat Victoria. "

"God damn it, Lumi, not only your obsession with Victoria is highly unhealthy, but you're also derailing the conversation. We need to collect a flask of the itching liquid from them as evidence and report it to adults before this exploit gets out of control!"

"You know, we're handling crisis after crisis after crisis, and we have to convince people to go to war time and time again every time something happens."

"What are you saying?" - Kate asks, thinking Lumi is about to give up on providing justice to everyone.

"How about we organize a group that would enforce our local Geneva Convention and punish anyone who violates it, and simply just everyone who's deliberately trying to bring chaos to the lab like the rainbow gas guy?"

"That's amazing, Lumi! Let's do it!"

"Awesome. I am gonna get my classmates to join in and you can get Nathan to get your classmates to join in. "

"That sounds great! I can take lead of the whole organization, I've been doing this for years. "

"Oh come on, Kate, don't you think a kid with powers would do a better job rallying everyone behind them?"

"Lumi."

"What?"

"Are you planning to use the army to get back at Victoria?"

"No, of course not." - Lumi says, trying to sound casual.

"Promise me you won't abuse your power to get back at Victoria. I will not help you assemble another plan to get back at her."

"Alright, alright. I promise. " - she replied in a defeated tone.

"Then you can be in charge and I will help you getting started. Thanks for being reasonable for a change."

"Aw thanks- wait, what do you mean for a change?"

Cut to Kate approaching Nathan, who is practicing casting spells.

"Hey, Nathan, wanna hear something?"

"Yes, Kate?"

"Well. Me and Lumi are starting a new organization to officially enforce the regulations we've all agreed on during all these years."

"Is this about the itching liquid incident? Whats the problem with just organizing an army and kicking their ass?"

"Well, I feel like it'd help to make the process more streamlined, you know? "

"Look, I wouldn't mind helping you two, but here's the problem: Victoria will kick my ass if she finds out I went behind her back to agree to this. This whole thing is set up to get back at her, right? "

"No, actually, she promised me that it isn't."

"Well, there's another problem. Victoria values money above all, and she will almost certainly get in the conflict of interest with your organization. She values money, you value order. She will never approve of this."

"Damn it, you're right. Have a good day."

Kate starts going somewhere, but Adrian comes near her. "Hey, Kate, can we talk?"

"Of course, what's up? "

"It's Lumi. She's starting to become very painful to be around. She's completely consumed by the idea to make Victoria pay. I don't know what to do anymore."

"I think I managed to get her distracted with the idea to make an organization to uphold the agreed laws of warfare. Hopefully that should help."

"Jesus, why can't she just quit? She'll have her heart impaled by an ice spike and her undead body will continue fighting Victoria until the end of time. Fucking fuck. "

"She promised not to do anything of the sort."

"I wouldn't trust anything that monster has promised. "

"Adrian, she's your gf!"

"Well I am tired of being pushed around, okay!" He walks away, sits down and starts thinking.

"Kate doesn't want to help me, Lumi is completely out of control. What if the boys can help? "

He approaches a "brother" of his while he's sparring with someone.

"Hey, \*name\*, can you help me with something real quick? "

"Sure, no problem. Timeout, i need a break for a few minutes."

They sit down on a bench together.

"You know Lumina, right?"

"Yea, I do. Your gf is a hero apparently who saved this lab numerous times, yet i still have a very bad feeling about her. "

"Yea, well, so do I. She gets her ass kicked by Victoria again and again, and she just won't quit thinking about her, and now she's founding some sort of police unit where she will absolutely abuse her power and try another rematch, getting me and Kate trapped with her in an ice bubble. "

"Well, she's a girl, of course she's highly emotional, obsessive and manipulative."

"Not all of them are like that, you know. I have a friend who is neither of those things."

"Yea, sure. Anyway, my advice? Dump her. Be free from that succubus. "

"But how could I do that? I'd feel alone and i'd suffer if I did that. "

"Trust me, it'll be better that way."

A checklist in Adrian's head is shown, with lines "Kate, The Boys, Parents\*, with Kate and The Boys being checked.

Cut to Adrian sitting in his room with his parents.

"So that's pretty much everything that's happened. I was suggested to dump her, but I don't want to, I know there's some good in her."

"Oh, son, I know what this is about. She thinks she can control you, and evidently she sort of can. She wants to assert her authority over you." - says Dad.

"But she told me that defeating Victoria once and for all would be for mine and everyone's good! She cares about me, but she is fucking insane and completely lost in her obsession. "

"Just because she told you that doesn't mean she actually means it! Have you considered that she's not obsessed with protecting you, but instead obsessed, period? " - suggests Mom.

"But she was always nice to me."

"Look, son, you need to assert your authority over her. Tell her that you will not stand for her bullshit and set some boundaries, and threaten to leave her if she doesn't respect them. Or pay Victoria to kick her ass if she refuses to cooperate with you."

"Alright. Thanks, guys."

Cut to Adrian walking outside.

"Yea, as if a threat of leaving her is good leverage, she'll just go nuts and put me in a hospital." The checklist is shown, with Parents being checked this time. "Paying Victoria will only anger her for sure and put a further rift between us. Wait. Paying Victoria. What if she knows something? She's a wonderful speaker, she masterfully defeated me, Lumi and Nathan verbally when we were trying to convince our block not to assault block 80 to avoid the ambush by the girls." A new line called Victoria appears in the checklist.

Adrian looks at Victoria from afar. She is on her phone, as per usual. "It's okay, Addie, everything will be fine if you don't treat her as your worst enemy and choose your words carefully. Holy shit. Holy shit. " He finally decides to come close.

"What? Here to invite me into another trap?"

"Hi. Nope, just here to talk." - he says with audible fear in his voice.

"Okay. What's this about?"

Adrian takes a deep breath. "I have problems with Lumina, I think she lost her mind in her chase to exact revenge on you and she just refuses to treat me with affection and love anymore. I wanted to ask you if you knew how to make her less of a bitch, I mean you did masterfully cover up the girl rampage conspiracy that one time. "

"\*sigh\* For fuck's sake. I am not your therapist, or your parent. Scram."

"What if I transfer you 5 tokens?"

"Make it 10 and you get a few minutes. "

"Deal." He transfers her the tokens and shows that they've been transferred.

"Okay, sit down and tell me the full story."

"Alright. So,..."

Cut to the end of his explanation.

"...And everyone I talked to proposed me completely ridiculous suggestions like dumping her, setting boundaries and threatening her with a breakup or with paying you to kick her ass if she doesn't respect them. I want to know what would you do."

"I like the idea of paying me to kick her ass, why not go with that?"

Anxious pause. "Because it will certainly create a rift in our relationship and will make her highly distrust me."

"Hmm. Perhaps. Anyway, there's another option of what you could do. It's a basic manipulation tactic called a Cold Shoulder."

"Never heard of it, continue."

"You know how we girls plotted to give you boys hell to extract concessions from you? This is similar, however, instead of doing that, just ignore her and pay her no attention whatsoever. When she tells you anything at all, ignore her completely. Try not to avoid Kate too, because if Lumina sees you interacting with her like normal while completely ignoring her, it'll make her feel more excluded and will achieve better results. Of course, if just listening to her starts being painful in of itself, it's okay to get away from her. Keep doing that for a few days, a week if it's really bad, and use the threat of doing that again to extract a concession from her: a concession of respecting your boundaries. Take into account that overdoing it will make her feel like she's walking on eggshells which will be highly damaging to your relationship. "

"Wow. Thank you."

"You're welcome. I need to get back to it."

"Before I go, I wanted to ask something else."

"No, I won't imprison you in an ice bubble along with her if I am paid to destroy her again, she'd have to attack me first for me to do that", Victoria said in a mildly bored and annoyed tone.

Adrian gets mildly scared. "Not that, I just wanted to ask, why do you like tokens so much?"

"What do you mean?"

"I see you don't mind fighting or even torturing people, if it brings you money, but I am interested to know why do you need the money in the first place. I know you're not all bad on the inside, so what motivates you?"

She puts her hand in her pocket with the ice balls, and thinks for a moment before deciding not to pull it out. "It's none of your business."

"I just want to understand how you feel, you know."

"It's best that you stop right here before you get way too deep and regret starting it all. I am out of patience. Leave me alone now."

"Have a good day and thank you!"

Next morning, Adrian and Kate are seen playing checkers together at a table between. Lumina comes around and says, "Guys! Guys! More blocks have agreed to join our cause! We'll succeed in this!"

"Oh nice one, good job, Lumi."

"Hi, Addie." - says Lumi, noticing that he hasn't responded.

Silence. "I said hi, shithead."

"Lumi, you aren't really being very nice to him."

"I am! I do everything for him while he does nothing for me, I need to vent out my emotions somehow!"

Silence.

"Adrian, are you gonna finish your turn?"

"Alright." Shortly after, he makes a move.

"What the fuck do you think you're doing, you piss drinker? Are you upset at me because I want the best for all of us, huh? Is that what this is about?"

Silence.

"Alright, fine. I am outta here. I'll be waiting for you when you come to your senses."

Silence. Lumina stomps away in anger.

"Damn it. You guys need to make up somehow. Don't keep this going for too long, I am starting to get tired of you guys bickering instead of being sweet and tender to eachother. "

\*sigh\* "Yeaaaaa, same."

Cut to Lumina, Kate and several block leaders sitting at a table inside a rented room in block 83, including the lightning guy from E3 and Vasiliy the redhead.

"Thank you all for coming. There are several things I want to do at this meeting: discussing whenever we should add, change or delete any laws of warfare from being enforced by our unit, including making sure we all agree to apprehend that one block that uses itching liquid in war, and, of course, making a private group on LabSocial to be used to rally our armies. Does anyone have anything to say?"

The lightning guy from the third episode raises his hand and is given the right to speak. "Thank you. As you all know, the powdered sleeping gas is forbidden to use in warfare, but allowed to use in personal duels with no restrictions. My proposal is that we ban its usage entirely in any situation to prevent it from being used in war by those who don't know about the regulation, and ask the adults to take away our rights to buy it. It'd be for the best of all of us. Thank you. "

"That's an interesting argument. Yes, Kate, you have the right to speak. "

"I should let you all know that during the rainbow gas epidemic I used powdered sleeping gas against the drunken zombies that were ravaging the streets, and it arguably was the reason Lumina, Bob and I made it to the perpetrator of the crisis and defeated him, mostly Lumina but we helped a little. That said, decide for yourselves if we should ban it or not, but have no doubt that by banning it's usage globally we lose access to use it in emergency situations which is very bad. Thank you. "

"Alright, thank you, Kate, now it's time to vote on whenever we ban the usage of the powdered sleeping gas, or not. Everyone against the ban, raise your hand."

4 out 8 people raised their hands.

"Hey, why is Kate allowed to vote, she's not even a block leader!" - someone said. Kate starts looking angry.

"Because she's my friend and the sanest person in block 85 and I say she's allowed and it's final. " Kate starts smiling. "Dude, we're tied! 4 to 4, how did this happen? Now what do we do?"

The door starts opening. "Hey, who the fuck forgot to lock the door? This is supposed to be a secret meeting between block leaders. "

Victoria comes. "What you guys who raised your hands need to understand is that I don't do drugs, and therefore next time a rainbow gas zombie crisis happens, I will be freely available to get to the one who caused the crisis in the first place and bring them the cold, gruesome justice. " Everyone is shocked.

"Who the fuck told you where we are?" - asks Lumina.

"Oh, did you really think I'd want to miss this opportunity? You see, if I join in, you will be guaranteed success in all of your operations, and also you will be protected from, well, myself being hired by the right person to break this whole thing apart for a measly, let's say 350 tokens or something like that." - she sits on a free chair.

"You dare barge in here and extort us into letting you join us?"

"No, I barged in here to extort you into letting me and most of my class to join you, aswell as 1 token a day from every single block member under the jurisdiction of this organization."

Everyone looks around in shock. "If you're here to rob us, you can go home and go fuck yourself. " - says Lumina.

"She kind of has a point, Lumi, we do need to guarantee that this whole thing doesn't fall apart in a week." - says Kate.

"YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Anyway, Victoria, get the fuck out."

"Oh no, that's not how \*you\* do things around here. Everyone in favor of accepting the deal, raise your hand. "

Everyone but Lumina and some other block leader raises their hand. "God damn it! You all sold us out to the devil!"

"Thank you for your cooperation, gentlemen. You've chosen the lesser evil."

S1E10 The Climax

Later that day, an army of kids is marching on the block of children who use itching liquid in combat. Soldiers in front have all of their skin covered by whichever means available. Lumina is marching in front, side by side with Vasiliy. When they arrive to their destination, Lumina starts a speech:

"End of the line, you pubes. Surrender your weapons now or we'll give you a free visit to the doctor."

Some of the defenders start putting down their flasks and swords, seeing how vastly they're outnumbered. At some point, someone says, "If they get a hold on a single flask, they'll rat us out and we're done for! Fight for your freedoms to the last man!" and everyone picks their weapons back up and charges. Vasiliy is shown to make attacking kids cry and grab their heads from pain, and Lumina is shown charging at the enemy with her lightsaber drawn. She takes a swing at an enemy soldier's flask of itching water, which produces a small explosion, causing the enemy soldier's hand to get burnt by the itching liquid. He screams in pain and collapses on the ground.

Everyone notices this and throws away their flasks. Lumina manages to explode some of the bottles with her eye lasers from those who didn't notice or were too late to throw, and to continue burning through the remaining enemies. It wasn't long before the battle was over and the kids who used the itching liquid in combat were jailed. Lumina's organization got a name GOEW, which means "global organization of ethical warfare", and is shown to get a massive popularity boost.

Cut to Lumina walking around with a brand new GOEW leader badge. She reads from her phone that a block is reported raiding nearby blocks and imprisoning a ton of people from there in cages with no food or a place to shit, and they also have a huge guy named Giant Gary who is reportedly impervious to pain and is also super strong and surprisingly agile for his size. The group chat of the commanders decides that the optimal combo to handle him would be Vasiliy and Victoria, but Vasiliy is grounded for using his power on his teacher, so the optimal combo ends up being Victoria, Nathan and Lumina. Lumina refuses to work with Victoria, but they're left with no other choice.

Cut to a GOEW army marching on the Giant Gary's block, a block of 8 year olds, with Lumina, Nathan and Victoria in front. Lumina looks visibly pissed, Nathan looks visibly alarmed, and Victoria looks visibly bored (and she's also in her phone).

When the allied army arrives, the enemies draw their weapons and make a formation. Giant Gary, a bald, shirtless hunk of a man 2 times the size of a normal 8 year old boy comes out and picks up his greathammer and goes ahead of everyone else. Tons of cages are seen in the distance filled with children, who start cheering for the invaders.

"GIANT GARY! How about you and the three of us step aside and curb stomp the fuck out of you." - opens Lumina.

"Prove to everyone that you're strong enough to defeat 3 powerful casters, or you will be forever known as a Giant Coward." - continues Victoria.

Lumina is mildly fuming that Victoria is stealing her show. Nathan says nothing, just readies a huge fireball.

"I accept your challenge, brave warriors. May the strongest win!" - he says in a very deep voice. All 4 step to the side on the road to have all the room they need for a big fight. The armies in the distance charge at one another. "Ma'am, are you sure you're in appropriate clothes for combat?" - Gary asks Victoria.

"I really don't care."

Lumina thinks, "If we lose this because of her, at least she'll know that her arrogance won't take her this far. "

Gary starts charging at the trio with his greathammer. Lumina dashes to the left side and starts firing eye lasers at Gary, Victoria dashes to the opposite side and starts blasting Gary with ice ball grenades, while Nathan throws the absolutely enormous fireball at Gary. He stops for a moment to punch the fireball with his left handed fist, blowing up the fireball in pieces. Gary's fist becomes visibly burnt, but he continues to manipulate it like nothing happened. Nathan jumps to the right to avoid the shards of his own fireball. Gary reacts to that in time and goes for a stomp attack, but Nathan manages to roll over to the side to dodge it, then quickly stand up and sprint to where Victoria was after the fight started. At the same time, Victoria turns a couple ice balls into some ice dust, and then puts it all into Gary's underpants and walks back to avoid a counterattack. It has no visible effect. "Okay, that might start draining his strength enough for us to win", thinks Lumi. She also draws her sword in the dagger form after realizing that the burns from her laser have no effect. Gary turns around, and Nathan and Lumina go behind Gary. "Target the back of his knees", Lumina whispers to him. Gary takes a hammer swing at Victoria after sprinting a little to be able to reach her. Realizing he is swinging too low to duck the attack and he's too close to backstep the attack, she turns both the ice balls in her hands into a shield and deflects the hammer swing, barely keeping balance in the process. At the same time, Nathan fires a medium sized fireball at the back of Gary's right knee, then Lumina starts burning it with her lightdagger. While that was going on, Gary barely flinched from Victoria's deflect and proceeded to kick Victoria with his left leg, however the kick landed on her shield, knocking it out of her arms, pushing her to the right further and staggering her. At the same time, however, Gary's right leg stopped working due to severe burns, so he collapsed backwards right on Lumina. She noticed him falling on her at the last moment and turned around to sprint away, but she still got slammed with all of Gary's weight, minus her head, groaned in pain for a few moments, and fell unconscious. After recovering from her stagger, Victoria grabs a few ice balls and shatters them right into Gary's face, with some shards landing on Lumina instead (who was unconscious at this point from a pain shock). Nathan uses his mini Flamethrower spell on Gary's face. As they're doing that, Gary yells, "I surrender! You win!". Victoria and Nathan stop attacking him and move away. Gary rolls over to the right and says,"My right ankle doesn't seem to move anymore. Good job finding that weak spot, you guys."

"Nathan, I want you to come closer to our armies fighting and loudly announce to them that Giant Gary has been incapacitated."

"Yes, Ma'am. STOP FIGHTING! GIANT GARY IS DOWN!"

Both sides look to the side and see the results of the battle and the defenders sheathe their weapons and put their hands in the air.

"Everyone, release the prisoners. Nathan, call the adults and tell them that Lumina and Gary are both incapacitated. I am off."

"Will do, Ma'am."

Cut to the first school break from the next day. Kate approaches Adrian.

"Sup, Kate."

"Hey. Dude, you won't believe the news. "

"Is it about Lumi and yesterday's showdown?"

"Yep, you guessed it. She had a lot of her bones fractured by Gary's immense weight. Thankfully, the cost of the surgery will be paid by the kids she imprisoned yesterday, but it will still be 3 days before she can safely walk again. "

"3 days? Wow. I suppose I should visit her to avoid angering her."

"To avoid angering her, seriously? Come on."

"Yea, you're right, she'll be angry at me no matter what I do. Still, it should at least ease her anger."

Kate facepalms and takes a deep breath. "While that is a good decision, even for all the wrong reasons, she is not in the lab, actually. She doesn't have a connection to LabSocial, either, so she's completely cut off from all of us until she's able to walk without risk."

"Oh no. Oh no no no no no no."

"Aren't you happy to get more time away from her?"

"She wouldn't be there to prevent Victoria from taking over the GOEW. And if Victoria does take over, she will for sure challenge her to a duel out of anger and jealousy, will inevitably lose and all 3 of us will have to spend the rest of our day in an ice bubble. "

"Oh fuck, you're so right, the fuck do we do?"

"I think I have an idea. All you need to do is take charge of the organization instead of her for now. If she tries to blackmail you into surrendering the leadership to her or increasing the Victoria tax, it's best that you don't go with it unless she threatens you with violence directly, because at that point, the disaster is inevitable."

"Wait, so, what's the big idea?"

"You'll see, just keep your distance and watch me from afar. "

"Alright, I am watching."

Adrian approaches Victoria, still shivering a little with fear. "Hey, can I talk to you about GOEW for a sec?"

"Make it quick."

Adrian takes a deep breath. "I would like to join the organization as a standard soldier, but I just don't wanna wait until Lumina recovers and then face her with that request. Can you get me in? "

"Sure thing. I'll invite you to the server, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted. Is that all?"

"No actually. Look, as far as you know, Lumina is in the hospital outside of the lab with no connection to us. "

"She is and it isn't my fault."

"I know, but… Can you please not take over the GOEW and not extort any extra cash from the organization? If you do, she'll be angry and she'll come at you, and, well, you know. "

"Why do you look like I am about to attack you for no reason?"

"Isn't that, like, your thing?" Adrian covers his mouth as if he said something that's about to get him killed.

" I know we've been through a lot together, but I have no reasons to hurt you. I mean, I would… I wouldn't have to attack you if you don't attack me or anything. I can make you a deal, you and Kate. If you don't side with Lumina in our next battle, I won't put you in an ice bubble when I kick her ass. Does that work? "

"Yea, you got it. I just want her to go back to normal at this point, and if she doesn't learn to control her obsessions, she'll always remain the bitch she is. Oh, I am rambling. Thank you."

"Also, I've made a deal with the organization that I stay there and serve it for the cash they transfer to me, and I do not intend to alter it to protect the image of my integrity as a mercenary unless she scams me out of it first. It's simply unwise to scam your employers out of something, because everyone will quickly find out afterwards that you're an opportunistic backstabbing piece of shit. "

"Oh my god. That's a relief."

"It's in my best interests for her to leave me alone too."

"I will do my best to keep her away from you."

Long silence. "I think it's time for you to go."

"Alright, goodbye!"

Adrian returned to Kate. "Are you okay? Holy shit dude."

"I am fine. She agreed not to demand any more concessions, saying the last thing she wants is to fight Lumi again. She's on our side. "

"On our side? I can't believe it. Oh, what is going on, it was so simple before this crusade of Lumi's…"

"We might be able to fix this. Anyway, wanna stop thinking about all this and just play something? "

Kate and Adrian are seen playing games together and just hanging out, sometimes with other boys, while Victoria is shown annihilating an entire class with her shattering ice balls.

Eventually, the day of Lumina's return comes around. Kate and Adrian are walking to block 83 to greet her during the first school lesson.

"Just how we planned, homie. We group hug her from different sides and show our overwhelming support, and do NOT bring up Victoria or the tensions between you two and do our best to derail the conversation if she tries to lead it there."

"Let's do this." - Adrian replied with mild anxiety.

When they arrive, they look around, and she's nowhere to be found.

"They said she would come back in the morning, so where is she?"

"If her classmates don't know, nobody would. "

Kate and Adrian approach a random classmate of hers, who happens to be Bob.

"Hey guys! Looking for Lumi?"

"That's right, we are."

"She's been at school today, but after the first class she just started ignoring anyone and running away somewhere."

"Oh fuck! She's hiding from everyone!"

"Thanks, Bob, have a good day! "

As the duo walks away, Adrian gets an idea to dm her.

"I am gonna dm her."

"Me too."

After they type their messages, Kate continues, "Now we wait and watch out for notifications."

After the classes are over, the duo opens their phones and checks dms. "Nothing."

"Where is she?"

"Oh my god. She's calling an emergency meeting of the GOEW at her block's location which will start in 27 minutes!" - notices Kate.

"Oh for fuck's sake, this better not be about you know who." - Adrian said with mild boredom and frustration.

"Let's go there and do our best to convince her to back down."

"You go. I am gonna get some help."

"How would Victoria help you?"

"Oh, no, I meant the teens from block 98. What if their words can tip the balance enough for us to convince her?"

"Alright, go on, see you at the meeting."

Kate is shown sprinting to block 83, where a crowd is slowly assembling and Lumina is walking around in front side to side. Kate sprints at Kate to hug her. "Lumiiiii!"

"Hey sweetie, I missed you."

"Me too!"

"I got it, Kate. You just need to sit back and watch."

"Lumi, what have you promised me?"

"That I wouldn't abuse my power as the leader of the organization to get back at \*her\*, yes, but don't you see? She tried to steal my throne as the leader, because of course she would! I can't just sit back and let her do it! "

"Dude, she did no such thing. I was in charge while you were gone and she didn't even have it in her thoughts to take over or even extract more cash from us."

"But look at our server! When you were confused about what to do when someone suggested we should ban hitting boys in the balls, she reminded you that the standard protocol in situations like this is to vote."

"So?"

"So she is gaining more soft power by showing everyone she's more competent and knowledgeable than you were and it's completely unacceptable!"

Silence. "I give up. See you around. "

"You can't ignore the truth, Kate! She did try to take over!"

Cut to Adrian approaching block 98, where the teens are playing "spin the bottle". When they notice him, one of them says, "Hey, what do you think you're doing here? You're too young to observe this stuff."

"While I am interested to know what is this ritual that you guys are doing, there's a bigger problem at hand. Lumina has gone crazy and has been completely consumed by vengeance and she's about to abuse her power as the leader of GOEW to get back at her archrival!"

"The fuck's GOEW?"

"Global organization of ethical warfare."

"Look, this sounds like a way too complicated of an issue for us to get involved. We prefer when things are simple: there's a team A and team B, with team A being the allies and team B being the enemies."

"Welp, I tried."

Back to Lumina, everyone is waiting. The block leaders are standing in front, everyone else is looking at them.

"Ma'am, when are we starting?"

"When Victoria arrives, we shall begin."

Then she is seen approaching in the distance. More people start pulling out their phones and recording what's about to happen.

"Lumina, are you here to publicly forgive me so we can be friends and live happily ever after?"

"Don't mock me, you twat. Now, we all know what we're here to discuss. Victoria has taken advantage of my sick leave to try to take over the organization so she can suck all the money she can out of everyone." Every block leader except Victoria and Lumina join the crowd, realizing they're not a part of the show.

"God. Here we go again."

"You have abused my kindness and trust for the last time! What do you have to say for yourself, traitor?"

"This is starting to really bore me. I know you're here for another rematch, so let's get this over with already, so I can put you in an ice bubble again and be free from you bothering me."

Adrian comes out from behind a corner. "Lumina, this has gone far enough!"

"Toxic relationship drama incoming." - says Victoria with big ice balls in her hands, ready to jump into battle at any moment.

"Victoria, shut the fuck up! Adrian, what are you doing? I am trying to do a thing here!" - says Lumina.

"We need to have a serious conversation. You've become highly explosive and unstable and we need to get you back to normal." - he stands to the side of Victoria.

"Are you fucking serious? You're standing near Victoria, who tortured you and threatened me with imprisoning you if I attack her again, and for some reason I am a bigger problem? The fuck is wrong with you?"

"This is exactly what am I talking about. You ceased to understand reason, you ceased to be able to control your emotions. Do you not even care about me anymore?"

"That's it! Everyone, let's kick Victoria's ass at last and be free from her tyranny! Adrian, get the fuck out of here, I'll deal with you later."

Literally nobody in the crowd moves, except one single guy who starts approaching Lumina, but before he reaches her, Victoria throws an ice ball grenade at him. Lumina tries to shoot it midair to make it explode, but misses, and the grenade lands right on the guy's head, after which he collapses on the ground. "If anyone wants a trip to the Arctic, feel free to repeat after him." Adrian puts himself in front of Victoria and stands in a T pose. "If you wanna fight her, you're gonna have to get me out of your way, first. You need to let it go."

"You son of a bitch! Your bluff is as visible as the sun in the sky. Stand aside, or I will blast you."

Adrian closes his eyes and starts thinking, "God you're such an annoying, stupid piece of shit. You don't care about me, or anyone at all, and all you think about is about how to satisfy your fragile pride. You're a horrible human being-"

At the same time, Victoria ducks under Adrian's arm and says, "He is absolutely right, you got to let it go. Let's say you win, what's next? Will you feel better? No, you're only going to feel empty because you will realize how much time did you waste on me while you could be doing so much more, like making friends, playing games, treating your partner with any dignity at all. Seriously, enough of this."

At this point Lumina has collapsed on her knees and grabbed her head by the sides. "What is this… Get it away! Get it away! Those words don't exist!"

Adrian opens his eyes, puzzled. "What's up her ass, Adrian?" - he is asked by Victoria.

"I have a guess." He closes his eyes again and continues thinking, "That's right. You're a worthless whore, Lumina. The only big thing in your life is your ego and how much you overcompensate for being an absolute loser."

"Nooo, not again! Aaaaagh!"

"The fuck's going on?" - Victoria asks.

Suddenly, Lumina starts shaking, a giant wing made of light appears behind her, then another. "Is that… How you felt about me all this time? Why would… You not tell me about any of this?" Her voice changes to sound more divine.

"Oh for fuck's sake, I leveled her up."

Lumina stands up. When Lumina starts shaking, Victoria pulls out a handle of a sword, and combines it and an ice ball to make an ice sword, then gives it to Adrian. Then she pulls out a lid of a trashcan and adds a protective layer of ice over it, then gives it to Adrian aswell. Then she unties her dress and takes it off, revealing a suit of actually combat viable light blue and blue clothes underneath, before finally arming herself with 2 ice balls again and assuming an imposing stance. Adrian holds his shield up aswell. Lumina stomps the ground very loudly and produces a monstrous roar.

Lumina starts shooting eye lasers at Adrian, while he charges at her with his shield up, blocking all the lasers. In the meantime, Victoria sprints to the right of Lumina and starts throwing ice ball grenades at her, which land on her chest, not dealing any serious damage but damaging her posture a little. As Adrian is charging, he notices ice shards flying from his shield. "Shit, she can penentrate the ice now!" - he thinks. When he comes close, he's going for a shield bash to her face, but Lumina jumps very high up, frontflips and tries to goomba stomp Adrian. However, another ice ball grenade from Victoria throws her off balance mid air a little, and Adrian manages to stab her foot with his sword, causing Lumi to trip and fall backwards. Adrian goes for a stab with his sword under her protective visor while still keepinh his guard up , while Victoria dashes around behind her and bends over with the intention of taking off her visor. However, Lumina quickly pulls out her lightsaber, activates it abnormally quick and aims for Adrian's right hand, to which he kicks her to the side to get a window to get away from her. In the meantime, Victoria takes off the visor and puts it on herself. Lumina then rolls over to the right and jumps back up to a standing position with her hands and wings, then turns around and swings at Adrian with her lightsaber. He successfully and swiftly deflects the swing and goes for a counterattack slash at Lumina's head, which hurts her a little because it's an ice sword, but otherwise deals no damage. Victoria tries to take advantage of the attack window and throw a shattering ice ball into her face, but before the ball could be shattered, Lumina slashes the ball in half and removes most of the momentum the halves had, and when it shatters, some shards land on Lumina's feet, dealing no damage. Lumina then sprints away, while Victoria prepares 2 bigger ice balls, and Adrian telepathically tells Lumina, "You will never defeat Victoria. You'll never be cool enough. Give up." Lumi staggers for a sec, but still turns around, flies up, fires a laser at Victoria and lunges at her with her lightsaber. "I bet 100 tokens you will completely miss this attack and fall into the dirt", Adrian telepathically tells her, but it doesn't seem to have any visible effect this time. When Lumina starts getting close to Victoria, she turns the big ice balls in her hands into a giant shield with an ice spike in front, stabbing Lumina with it. Instead of falling down this time, she flies backwards, putting her left hand on her chest where she got thrusted. Victoria tears a large fragment of the shield, turns it into a ball of ice and throws it into Lumina's face, which she manages to dodge by flying down a little. "The only way for you to come out of this battle victorious is to surrender and admit that you've gone too far. It's not too late." - Adrian tells Lumina telepathically, to which she verbally replies, "Enough!" and activates her super speed and starts dashing midair erratically, then dashes right onto Adrian from above. He reacts in time and blocks it with his shield, but the force of the strike is so strong that he is completely knocked down, and then also the trashcan is penetrated by the lightsaber and Adrian's left hand gets burnt too. He says aw and drops his shield because it's too painful to hold at this point. At the same time, Victoria compresses her spike shield into a big ice ball and throws it at Lumina as a shattering ice ball. The force of the shards manage to knock her down to the opposite side from Adrian, to which Adrian responds by trying to put his ice sword against Lumina's face, to which Lumina tries to put her lightsaber against Adrian's torso aswell, but before she can do that, Victoria comes around and blasts 2 shattering ice balls right into Lumina's face, causing her so much pain that her lightsaber turns off and she starts groaning in pain. Everyone starts clapping. Adrian rolls around and tries to stand up with his right hand, and Victoria helps by pulling him up to a standing position.

"Can't believe you went this far to prevent this from happening. Thank you for taking my side."

"No worries! It was a choice between a manipulative sociopath and an even more manipulative even more sociopath." - he said with physical pain in his voice.

"Wow, how could you. Nah, you're right."

"So, what do we do with her?"

"Excuse me, can I announce some news to you three?" - Vasiliy walked closer to Victoria and Adrian with audible anxiety.

"Shoot." - Victoria replied.

"During the fight, the council members voted to dethrone Lumina as the head of GOEW. And no, you're not replacing her, neither is Kate, who has been excluded from the council entirely because it's nepotism and she never should have been there in the first place. We will hold elections for the new leader shortly."

"Nooo… Fuck you guys…" - Lumina mumbled.

"I never wanted to be in charge anyway. " Vasiliy exhales in relief.

"Do you want me to put her in an ice bubble?" - Victoria asks.

Adrian thinks for a second. "No, Vici, don't bother. I am getting a feeling that just getting out of here would be the most optimal decision. "

"Alright. Lumina, you really don't have to be at my throat at all times. I know you're hurt, but you're gonna have to find another way. Haven't we worked together great during that Giant Gary fight?"

"You know she got crushed by the full weight of Gary at the end of that fight which led to this fight happening in the first place?"

"Get… Outta here… Both of you… Shitcunts…"

"I guess I did all I could. Let's go."

As they leave, everyone is clapping once again. "Victoria for fucking leader!" - someone said. In response, Victoria lets out an exasperated sigh.

"Well, Vici, I really need to get inside our block to have my burns treated. So, I guess I can see you around again when I am able?"

"Go ahead. I'd love to- I mean, I would be interested to… fuck it. Let's try to talk more and see if we can get along. "

"You bet!"

"I like the nickname of Vici, by the way. You get an exclusive right to call me that."

"Sweet!"

"Oh, almost forgot. Give me back the shield and I'll get it fixed up."

"Here you go."

Adrian is lying on his bed in his room with white bandages are covering his burns from the battle. It's evening outside. He gets a call from Kate.

"Hey, can you let me inside? I'd like to chat."

"Yea, one sec."

After they come inside, they sit down on the bed together.

"I saw the whole thing streamed live on LabSocial. Are you okay?"

"Oh that? Yea, I mean, why wouldn't I be?" He replies with a smile on his face."

"I don't know. A breakup? 2 third degree burns and 1 second degree burn? Fighting with Victoria side by side and somehow living to tell about it?"

"Okay, you got me on the burns, they really hurt. Can't really use my left hand for now, but other than that, I've never been happier with Lumina gone. Dude, I don't have to tolerate Lumina's bullshit ever again, because she attacked me! I am free!"

"Wowza. Sure hope you're not just saying that to cope."

"No. I mean, maybe, but how could I know?"

She hugs him. "If you ever need to talk about something, I am always here for you. While parents can be nice, their advice sometimes ends up weird and it's often better to ask people your age for help."

"Wow. Thank you."

She gets back into a comfortable position and puts an arm around Adrian's neck, to which he wraps his hand around her too. "So what's going on with you and Victoria? You two friends or something?"

"Oh, I wish. She's so awesome. After the first time I paid her so she could help me deal with Lumina when everyone else gave me garbage advice, she never demanded payment from me again for talking to her. We actually were entirely on the same page about Lumina by the time the fight happened, and we were ready to physically protect one another from harm. "

"Dude. Dude! Don't you remember her torturing you because we quote unquote stole her money? And now you're saying you like her?"

"I mean, I don't know. Maybe I deserved having some ice shoved into my clothes."

"What are you saying? You know I am as much responsible as you are for that incident! And have you considered that she stopped bullying you after you and Lumina became partners? "

"Yea, so? Wait, oh my god."

"She wasn't bullying you anymore because she didn't want confrontation with Lumina. That's the same reason she never bullied me, too. Now that you're no longer partners, nothing prevents her from torturing you again!"

"Hold on a minute, that doesn't make any sense. Why would she do any of that after we both stood together and fought against Lumina?"

Kate grabs her face with her free hand. "God damn it, why am I the only rational human being in this entire place."

Adrian looks at her and smiles. "God, I love you." - he thinks in his mind, accidentally activating his telepathy.

"Adrian?"

"What?"

"I think my subconsciousness just wants me to tell you that I love you and even if you don't always act rationally, that wouldn't change anything."

"Aww. Love you too!" - he's a little shocked by another accidental telepathic transmission.

A trio of girls are sitting in a room, one giving a presentation.

"So we all know we want to get Kate back into our team so we can just hang out and do girl stuff together, right?"

Then, a trio of Adrian's roommates are also sitting in a room, one giving a presentation too.

"The problem is that Adrian doesn't hang out with us anymore and doesn't even go with us to assault nearby blocks for some reason."

"So, here's the solution: Kate's only people she ever seems to talk to anymore seem to be Adrian and Lumina."

"... appear to be Kate and Victoria. Now we obviously…"

"...can't go after Lumina, but if we cross off Adrian off her friends list,..."

"... we might just have a chance of him hanging out with us again."

"So how do we make that happen?"

Next lesson, someone puts 2 notes on Adrian's desk. First reads, "Hey Adrian. You're a weirdo and honestly just a shit person in general and I don't want to talk to you anymore. Kate", second reads, "Adrian, I am tired of you being the lame ass loser that you are. Don't talk to me again or I will annihilate you with my ice balls. Victoria". Reading both of these puts Adrian into an intense state of shock. The teacher asks him, "Is there a problem, Adrian?"

"No, no. It's okay. Don't worry about it."

Kate reads her note that she got. "Kate, you're starting to become a really annoying cunt and I can't stand you anymore. Stay away from me. Adrian."

"God damn it, I shouldn't have said that everyone around me was irrational. Fuck."

After classes end, Adrian is approached by Victoria. He senses her behind him and gets startled:

"I am sorry, I am sorry, don't hurt me!"

"Why are you acting all terrified of me again?"

Adrian pulls out the note signed Victoria and shows it to her. She reads it for a moment.

"Didn't write this. Someone wants to forge a rift between us. Follow me, let's investigate at our usual place."

Adrian exhales in relief. The 3 "brothers" of Adrian watch in the distance.

"Shit! He showed her the note! The plan is fucked!"

When Adrian and Vici sit down, Vici begins:

"To figure out who tried to do this to you, we need to establish possible motives for why would they wanna put a rift between us. Let's begin with every possible motive they might have for doing this."

"Revenge."

"Yes, good, Lumina is definitely a suspect, what else?"

"Someone that cares about me thinks you're out of your mind and thinks it'd be better for me to not be around you. And the only person that could do something like this to me would be Kate, but I got a goodbye note from her too so it can't be her."

"Sounds reasonable. Here's another: someone wants you to spend less time with me and more time with them."

"The boys, yes. I don't know if they're that manipulative, though. "

"Well they are sort of suspect, though, right?"

Cut to Kate approaching her girl friends. "Hello."

"Kate! You're back! We missed you so much!" The girls form a group hug around Kate.

"Yea! Welcome back!"

"Thank you, guys."

"Aw, what's wrong, Katie?"

"It's Adrian. I think I indirectly called him unreasonable to which he took serious offense and broke off from me."

"Why did you call him unreasonable?"

"Because he has this platonic or not even platonic crush on Victoria and thinks she's super cool even tho I am pretty sure he has trauma from her."

The girls look at eachother in genuine shock. "Well, look at it this way, Katie. It sounds like you're really fed up with your new company. How about enjoying your old one?"

"Maybe you're right. Let's have some fun together and see what happens."

"Yay!"

Back to Vici.

"That leaves the boys as the most probable suspects."

"Then I guess I'll confront them about it."

"No, bad idea. You need to approach situations like that more gently. We don't even know for sure it's them, they're simply the most probable suspects. We have to stage a falling out between us, and then for you to start wandering around doing something on your phone and pretend to be sad and lonely. If that lures them to ask you to play with them, we got them. "

"How do we do that?"

"Start pretending to be shocked and get pissed off at me for what I am about to do. Dm me afterwards if you still wanna talk about something, just don't approach me before they out themselves."

"What?"

"You heard what I said. Ask me in dms for details if you don't understand something."

She grabs him by the neck. Her powers are deactivated so the hand isn't horribly cold, but it's still pretty chilly, triggering Adrian to get genuinely shocked (because of trauma and stuff). "I am pretending to say something intimidating. I am about to physically push you away, try to keep your balance. " - she tells him quietly and then physically pushes him up from the bench and away from her.

He walks away from her closer to where the majority of the block hangs out. Then he opens his phone and gets a message from Victoria:

"You're in position, good. Pretend to be sad and/or shocked and they're sure to take the bait. "

"Got it. Thank you for the warnings."

"You're welcome."

In the meantime, the girls are having fun painting on swords together. Kate still looks visibly sad.

Later, after classes are over, Adrian dms Victoria:

"They're not taking the bait. What do we do?"

"I know what could help. Sit tight."

"Alright."

Shortly after, the boys (not just the actually responsible ones) see something in their phones, and start talking to eachother, which eventually results in a group of 7 approaching Adrian and starting to ask him what happened.

Cut to Vici receiving a message of "They took the bait. 7 of them. Here are the names:.." and smiling as a result.

Several hours later, the girls are seen inside, this time with Kate present and the same one giving another presentation.

"Alright, girls, so the other week I saw an absolutely stunning headline on the news. Apparently, someone from block 97 is being investigated for possible prostitution."

"Gross!" - says Kate.

"Well, yes, it is. It's also illegal nationwide to sell sex. You know what isn't, though? That's right, selling kisses. That way we can make some major bread and also make the boys in our class happier and more inspired for battle! \*flips page\* My proposal is that we start with selling cheek kisses, lip kisses and deep lip kisses at various prices, that way we can pamper the customer in any way they want or have money for."

"Yea!" - the rest of the girls other than Kate exclaim.

"Are you guys serious? What about our womanly pride? Why do you need the tokens so much anyway?"

"Because we can eat all the cake and other exquisite food we want! Come on, Katie, I am sure you've wondered what would it feel like to taste that Blyatburger Deluxe XXL Ultra?"

"Well, yea, but…"

"You gotta try it! It'll be fun!"

Victoria is walking somewhere. While she's walking, she sees cardboard adverts for "Quality kisses", with directions on where they're done and who to talk to for suggestions/complaints. She takes a photo of the advert and continues on. She arrives at the rented room, where 7 boys from before are sitting and waiting for her. They get visibly terrified, Nathan less than others. She locks the door.

"What did we do? Please don't attack us. "

"Did I say talk? "

Silence.

"I have discovered a conspiracy to draw a rift between me and Adrian. It seems like some of you, or all of you, have forgotten that I am not someone to be fucked with. Nathan, I understand you remember what would happen if I discover you lying to me. Did you participate in the conspiracy? "

"First time I am hearing about it, I swear."

"Can you confirm or deny anyone's involvement in the conspiracy?"

"I mean, I wouldn't know. Ma'am."

"We have determined that whoever orchestrated this is either close to Adrian or used to be close to him. Do you know anyone who doesn't fit that description in this room?"

"Yea, me and these two." The 2 boys that Nathan pointed at exhale in relief. One of them covers his face from stress.

"So it's between the four of you. How about each one of you tell me who did it?"

"I have no idea, definitely not me."

"He (guy 1) did it, we warned him not to do this, he said he wouldn't and then he did it anyway."

"Yep, same."

"Yea, he… Okay, fuck this. Let's face it, guys, we fucked up and we're about to get our retribution. We would have had better chances doing something like this to our parents or our teacher. It was me, \*guy 3 name\* and…" He gets smacked in the face by guy 3 before he could finish.

"The only one who is allowed to attack anyone in this meeting is me. \*guy 4\*, continue. "

"It was me, \*guy 3\* and \*guy 2\*. Please, don't hurt me!"

"Then it's decided. \*guys 3 and 2\* will transfer me 50 tokens and \*guys 1 and 4\* will transfer me 25. If you fail to give me the money, I will turn you into a popsicle."

"Hey, but I didn't do anything!" - guy 1 said.

"There's a chance \*guy 4\* has been covering your ass and I need to make sure you understand the severity of this situation too."

In the meantime, Adrian is chilling in his house and browsing something in his phone, but then he reads that Victoria extorted a total of 150 tokens from some of the boys and is threatening to kick that one guy's ass who didn't have enough tokens to transfer if he doesn't pay them in a week. The extorted boys are physically fighting amongst themselves over not saying the same thing during the confrontation. "Shit. How did we let things get out of control this badly? "

In the meantime, the 4 girls have set up a cardboard booth to provide their services out of sight and are posing romantically. Some guy who is not important to the plotline of the episode pays them to get a lip kiss from Kate, gives them a thumbs up and walks away. The girls cheer for Kate.

"Okay, that honestly has been sort of nice. It's been a while."

"What have we told you, Katie?"

"Let's just see if doing it for the hundredth time would be worth the money. "

Suddenly, Victoria appears from the side, so everyone only notices her when she comes close. "Afternoon." Everyone is turning at her to stare at her in shock and fear, except Kate who is filled with anger.

"Victoria?"

"Sister, please don't mug us! We used to be friends, remember?"

"The fuck are you doing here? You took my friend away, now you're gonna take these away too?"

"He told me you broke off with him. " The other girls are shocked even more while Kate raises an eyebrow. "Jeez, why are you all so scared? It's like we never were friends in the first place. But that's irrelevant to the reason why I am here. I am here to talk business."

"Oh great, here we go again." - says Kate.

"Kate, you haven't even heard my offer, I swear it's not gonna be like the GOEW meeting."

"What are you two talking about?"

"Listen, girls. Do what I say and we will all walk out of here unharmed and with our business surviving. Now listen, Victoria, what's your offer? " - Katie asks.

"Not here. We need to get somewhere private. Come with me to the room for rent." As she's entering in, she gets a call, looks at who it is and rejects it. "Sorry, Adrian, the money is calling."

At the same time, Adrian goes outside to talk to the boys who are actually just beating the shit out of eachother. He tries to call Victoria as he walks towards them, but gets rejected. "Guys, can we talk for a minute?" - everyone stops fighting.

"Adrian?"

"Why did Victoria take so much of our money away?"

"Look. The thing is, we were trying to figure out all morning who could have been responsible for giving me that fake note. We figured it was some of you four, then she told me to sit tight and let her handle everything. I had no idea she was gonna take your cash away as punishment, I mean we're not even sure which one is actually responsible. "

The boys point fingers on everyone other than themselves (except guy 4 who tells the truth) and when they see where they're all pointing, they exclaim "Hey!" in a highly offended tone.

"This isn't the time for that. Before I make this right, I just want you to tell me: why did you do something so shitty to me? Why did you think it was a good idea to sabotage my life by taking my friend away instead of telling me that we could hang out again?" When he is finished saying that, he tells guy 3 telepathically, "You can't keep hiding the truth forever. It will be much easier if you tell it right away."

"Alright, thinking back, it was a really fucking stupid idea and we were playing with fire. But also, on top of that… Nah, I got nothing in terms of excuses, this was a fucked up thing to do." - said guy 4.

"I'll admit it too. We did it. We thought it would solve our problems, not create new ones." - said guy 3.

"We should also have provided alibi for everyone who was accused there to convince Victoria that none of us did it. That's was the most optimal solution to this prisoner's dilemma, knowing \*guy 1\* claimed he didn't do it and had no idea about anything." - said guy 2.

Awkward silence. "Hold on a second. We wrote a fake note from Kate aswell as from Victoria. Why did you say just 'friend' instead of 'friends'?"

Adrian is shocked. He pulls out both notes, sees that they are really similar, only written in a different font. He pulls out his phone and calls Kate.

In the meantime, Victoria begins explaining her proposal, reading stuff from her phone.

"Let us begin. I have analyzed the business model you all assembled, and I seriously think you could have done a better job. Don't bother writing anything down, I have it all written down in my notes already. First, you need to have more services to provide to your customers. "

'Victoria, fucking gross!"

"Kate, shut up a moment and let me talk. Basically, what we need is something cheap for those who don't want to spend much money but want affection anyway, and by that I mean hugs. Conversely, some customers might have a lot of tokens and we must have a way to pamper them like noone else can afford. I am talking about… " The girls are visibly disgusted.

"Neck licks." The girls become visibly confused.

"Yea, I know you all don't understand why that should be an option, but trust me, that will absolutely have demand. Next up, we have to put the cardboard adverts about this whole organization everywhere. Third, bundles and subscriptions-" Kate's phone started ringing.

"Adrian only calls me during emergencies. I need a moment. \*picks up her phone\* Hey, is everything okay? WHAT? Are you saying that some assholes have conspired to bring us these notes to break us apart??? Are their asses kicked to the ground yet?" The other girls look at eachother in fear.

"I already fined the guys responsible for this scheme for a lot of tokens, Kate. They won't try it again."

"Yea, she just told me that. Look, both of us are preoccupied right now, talk to you later, okay? Bye, homie. "

"As I was saying, subscriptions and bundles are both awesome ways to get our customers to spend more money. For example, we could sell a bundle of a hug and a kiss for 15% less than both of them individually. As soon as we realize that the business is not going anywhere, we could start selling subscriptions, allowing a person, for example, one kiss a day for the entire month, for only 75% of how much these would cost individually. It looks advantageous for the customer, but in reality more of them would become our daily customers because of how advantageous the deal looks. Fourth, security. I will provide ample security to the whole organization for a measly 15% of all earnings. "

"You promised this wouldn't be goddamn GOEW once again! Ugh! "

"After we start this, some competition will surely rise because of how successful we'll be, which will surely attract hostiles who will start attacking you all. Unless I am around."

"She's not wrong, Katie. We wouldn't find better security in the whole lab. Her psychotic aura will scare away anyone who'd wanna mess with us."

"Fuck!"

"Finally, social media marketing. All you need to know is that it will highly increase our customer supply and make us swim in tokens. That is all."

The girls start clapping. Kate is reluctant at first, but starts clapping after that aswell.

When Vici finally leaves, she calls Adrian.

"Hello. "

"Hey. Just wanted to ask, don't you think you went too hard on the four guys who orchestrated the note conspiracy?"

"Not here. Come meet me at my usual place."

"Alright."

When Victoria arrives, she begins:

"I really don't see where was the part where I went too hard on them. They tried to fuck us over, they got fucked over themselves. "

"Come on. 150 tokens? That's an absolutely huge sum of money. "

"Isn't our friendship more expensive than that?"

"It is, but they're my friends, you know. You need to do the right thing and give them back some of their cash. I don't want them to go broke. "

"Adrian, please. I really need that money. It's very important to me. "

"Okay, okay, how about this." He tries to put his hand on her hand, but she puts the hand away.

"Not now, maybe later."

"Sure thing. Anyway, here's the deal: I talked to the guys after you fined them, and it turns out that \*guy 1\* was entirely uninvolved in the scheme. So, I will allow you to have all of the tokens you initially took from everyone other than him, on one condition: you will tell me why do you like money so much and why do you need so much of it. "

She thinks for a moment. "You sure you don't want to, I don't know, kiss me or something instead?"

"Hey, I'll take it as a bonus, but no, I need to get to know you better by finding out what drives you. I mean, what if I can help?"

She looks around. "What if you can. Fine. It's freedom."

"What kinda freedom?"

"Escaping the lab. Living like a normal child. Theme parks, supermarkets, breaking random people's windows then running away before anyone manages to catch you. Looking at history being written in real time. Writing said history, perhaps. "

"Hold on, where's the connection between tokens and that?"

"I was told by my parents long ago that if I manage to amass 20000 tokens, I will know what the outside world looks like. I want to know that more than anything. "

S1E12 Dude, Brace Yourself, This Chapter Is Fucked

Adrian leaves class and gets approached by Victoria. They greet eachother and she beckons him to come with her. After they sit down, she begins:

"I have found a way for us to work together on something. You profit, I profit."

"Hey, anytime. Anything for my dear friend."

She looks noticeably happier. "Let me start with something. I know you have some sort of new power which nobody knows about. During our fight with your beloved girlfriend, she was randomly staggering, as if someone was nibbling at her very mind somehow. Was that you?"

"Yes. I don't talk about it at all so it remains an element of surprise for when I need it, but it is telepathy. I can project whatever thoughts I have onto others' minds. "

"Not bad. Show me."

"Despite you doing your best to look sinister, you're a wonderful human being." - he telepathically whispers to her.

"Wrong. That is powerful, though."

"Yea, I've used it on accident 2 times already. First time was when I first discovered it right before Lumina's transformation, second time was when I accidentally told Kate I love her through telepathy. It seems like whenever I focus on a person, intentionally or unintentionally, I am able to project my thoughts at them without saying anything."

"What on earth did you whisper to her to make giant wings grow out of her back?"

"Oh, you know. Was just telling her how much I hated her, pretty much. Just words of pure hatred."

"Nice. What were you whispering to her during the fight itself?"

"Standard demoralizing stuff. Convincing her that she can't win, she's wasting her time, she needs to give up, you get the idea."

"That's a decent angle. But there's so many other options you could try. Let's go closer to where people hang out so you can project a very high pitched sound onto some random classmate of ours so we can see what happens. "

"What if I get found out and punished for this? I feel like it would be safer to do it to someone from a different block. "

"It's whatever. Let's go."

They approach a random nearby block and start looking some boys playing football. "Go on. Sabotage their game. Blast the ears of anyone you'd like."

Adrian focuses on one of the gatekeepers and starts projecting a high pitched scream into his ears. The dude looks around for a few moments confused, but nothing happens.

"Okay, it's not very effective. Why won't you make some monstrous sounds, like a rabid dog is trying to attack him and eat him?"

"Let's try."

Adrian starts projecting sounds of a hungry animal into the same gatekeeper's brain. He loses his balance, falls to the ground and rolls into a ball, grabbing his head with his hands like his hand is hurting. "Impressive." - says Vici. But Adrian decides to try something else. He whispers the guy in a demonic tone:"The armies of hell are approaching the crust of the earth! The moment we appear, all life on earth will be destroyed and all will perish! The only way to stop it is for you to turn your ass away from the gate and pull down your pants so we can see your juicy earthling ass and be satisfied with what we got!"

As he is projecting this, the guy first stops acting like he is in great physical pain, gets confused for a moment, then stands up and pulls down his pants. Adrian pulls out his phone and takes a pic. "Did you just telepathically manipulate someone into showing their asshole, and then take a photo of it to admire later as a trophy?"

"That's about right."

"Wow. So twisted. So inspiring. So cool."

"No you."

"Hey, Victoria, is that you in that snazzy dress of yours?" - someone on the field asks her.

"Yea. What, looking for a quick pick me up? "

"Am I? Dude, fuck yea I am! Sending you 20 tokens right away for a lip kiss. "

"We're like the least sneaky people in the lab." - Adrian remarks.

"True."

She sees that the tokens have been transferred and kisses the customer. The duo start walking away.

"It's good that you have your newly unlocked powers, however, you should try to attack someone by making them disgusted and insane. "

"Continue."

"Insanity is the easier of the two. What you need to do is start reading the most deranged, depraved literature you can find into someone's brain. I will start writing the most perfect text for you to read to someone else today, but you're gonna have to start with already existing pieces of insane literature. I am mainly thinking of 50 Shades of Gray. "

"What's that?"

"Ancient smut written for girls with submissive sexual fantasies. Most people around our ages would be disgusted by what you would be reading them, since we are generally too young to develop sexual preferences or desires. It's perfect."

"How do you know all this, again?"

"There's a lot you don't know about me. I am interested when would be the part where you realize that I am way too weird to hang around, but all will come in due time."

"Wow. You're awesome."

"I seriously don't see what you like about me. But we're getting off topic. We have a lot of ancient literature available to us to download. Let's find and download the target book."

Later, both are sitting on a bench, Vici is in her phone, Adrian is looking at her phone too.

"Restricted access. We have to be at least 14 to access the book."

"Shit. You got any acquaintances among teens?."

"I do. Let's go after the next classroom break. "

Later, they approach one of the teen blocks. A teen girl notices Victoria.

"Vicci! How are you, sweetheart?"

"Hello, Sofi. I need a favor."

"Anything for you! How can I help?"

"I need you to put 50 shades of gray on my flash drive. And also, let me whisper you about something else."

Adrian raises an eyebrow. After she is done whispering, Sofia replies:

"Oooh, you're a fine arts connoisseur! I'll arrange everything. Thank you for stopping by!" Vici gets petted on the head, which causes her to crack a small smile.

"Should I worry about what was that something else?"

"Don't worry about it. You'll find out what it is within the following couple days. "

Sofia gets mildly shocked. "You sure about this, Vicci?"

"Trust me, it's not as bad as it looks, but I can't give you the full context."

"Well alright."

As they're walking back, Vici begins:

"Before she manages to get us what we need, I'd like you to do something for me. There's a rival kissing business in a block not far off from ours, and they have just straight up hotter girls and better prices than we do. When it comes to business. I want you to go near their block after classes and do your magic to nonviolently convince them all to stop what they're doing. What do you say? "

"Let's do this!"

"I know how to apply disgust to an 11 year old girl. Just listen to me and I will tell you what to whisper to them to make them regret what they're doing. "

During the last school class for the day, the teacher is explaining something about chemistry. One of Adrian's tablemates raises his hand asks the teacher:

"I really need to go to the bathroom. Can I please leave?"

"No, you can't. Wait it out and piss your pants if you have to."

Adrian starts telepathically whispering into the boy's ear through telepathy: "Hello, child. This is your grandma. I've come to tell you: if a teacher ever refuses you a bathroom break, it's completely legal and encouraged to stand up anyway and piss on the teacher, or shit on the floor in front of the whole class. Everyone has a right to the bathroom whenever they want to. Do it. Make grandma proud."

The kid stands up and walks up to the teacher.

"I thought I told you that you can't go to the bathroom. Sit down!"

Then he pulls out his wiener and starts pissing on the teacher. It takes him a second to realize what's going on and step out of the piss range. "The hell are you doing? Gross! Why? Why?"

"It's completely legal and encouraged to piss on your teacher if they refuse you a bathroom break."

"Who the fuck told you that?"

"My grandma."

"What??"

Some students are laughing. Some are looking at it in shock. Some are cheering. Adrian is smiling, looking at his work.

After the classes are over, Kate approaches Adrian. "Dude. Have you seen what that guy did?"

"Yea, I did, that was glorious."

"No, it wasn't! Someone mind controlled him to piss on our teacher. Do you know what this means? Anyone can be a mind controller here and we need to figure out who are they and stop them before this gets even more out of control!"

"You got a point, but I am really busy with something equally as important. I'll let you know when I am available to investigate this, okay?"

"God damn it, Adrian! This isn't like you!"

He shrugs and walks away to Victoria's corner.

"I absolutely can't believe you just did that. Insane. "

"Are you upset about this? "

"No. It was awesome. Grandma telling him that he can take a piss on the teacher? You're learning so fast.

Several clips show Adrian acting casual near near some girls that are working for a kissing business in another block, then suddenly the girls start quitting their jobs one by one. Next, Adrian telepathically manipulates a kid to fart on his date, to which she slaps him and stomps away angry. Next, he makes some guy go berserker and start trying to bite off the face of one of his friends. Next, he makes a girl pull down the pants of several boys.

Cut to a GOEW council where everyone is angrily talking about something. Vasiliy has been elected as the head of the force. Lumina is conveniently absent.

"Guys, stop! We can't all talk at the same time, that's not going to solve anything!"

"Someone is on the loose causing havoc to everyone indiscriminately! They're trying to make us all do embarrassing things against our will!"

"It's true. We need to go ahead and investigate every single target of those attacks to see if they know anything we don't."

In the meantime, Victoria is chatting on her phone with Sofia.

"Bring the flash drive to Nathan in my block. Tell him that if he loses it, he will lose his head too."

When everyone exits the room where the meeting took place, Victoria notices Adrian and comes close.

"How did it go?"

"We've got a problem. You managed to cause so much havoc in only several hours that Vasiliy called an emergency meeting to discuss what to do about the situation. Next time I am forcing Nathan to sit through all that instead of me. We're under so much heat and we're not nearly even done with unlocking your true potential."

"Yea. Did you get the flash drive yet? "

"Sort of. I will upload its contents onto my phone and send you the book. In the meantime, find yourself a target and wait for my message. To use its true power, open a random page and start reading it into someone's mind. Just remember: you figured this out all on your own. I've had nothing to do with any of it, I didn't even have any knowledge you were doing this."

"Alright. Thank you for helping me, Vici, it's been so much fun."

"Likewise. "

Cut to Adrian chilling near a random block. When he finally receives the book, he opens it on a random page and begins reading it into a random girl's mind. She looks confused at first, then disgusted, then starts crying, punching herself in the head and falls on her knees.

"Okay, that worked so good that I feel sorry now. But they can't find out it was me. Let's try a different target."

He tries it on a boy now, who gets confused, but then starts laughing. He tries it on another boy, who also starts confused, but then confusion turns to fear as he starts running around in circles and screaming loudly before running back to his house.

"Dude, I am a monster. I know all of this aside from the pissing on the teacher thing was perfectly legal, but it feels so wrong. It's like I am a big bad cartoon villain stomping on all the weaklings around me because I am somehow better than them. "

As Adrian is returning to Vici's favorite bench, he is approached by Kate, with her pneumatic pistol in left hand and her beautiful painted wooden sword in her right.

"The fuck are you doing, you asswipe?"

"What are you talking about?"

"You know what I am talking about! Your cover is blown. Lumina checked her phone, saw the news and told everyone it was you. Do you have any idea how much pain and suffering have you caused in a single day?"

"Hey, I am not going to lie, I really went overboard at the end there. "

"At the end? You've been a menace the whole time! Several boys have had their penises exposed, one had his ass exposed. Another farted on his girlfriend, still another tried to eat his friend's face off. " Adrian is uncomfortably trying to hide his smile.

"Look, I am sorry, okay? Please don't be mad at me."

"Me being mad at you should be the last thing that concerns you right now! Go publicly apologize to every single victim of what you did and to everyone in general!"

"I don't even know how many people I targeted with this. It all started fun, but the next thing I know is I went too far and everyone hates me."

"If you don't apologize, I will kick your ass right now."

"I don't want to fight you. You're my friend."

"Not until you do the right thing you're not!"

"I am not fighting you, go away."

She aims her pistol at Adrian and takes a shot, landing in his chest. He nearly falls down, but keeps his balance. She tries to aim another, but gets blasted from behind by a shattering ice ball. "Are you deaf? He doesn't wanna fight you. "

"I knew… You were a bitch… You did it together, didn't you?"

"How could I possibly be able to participate in this? Get out of here. I will deal with him myself."

Adrian gets scared.

"You will both pay… For what you've done…" She lies down on the ground. Victoria beckons Adrian to her bench, and he comes along with fear in the way he walks.

"I have a plan. I will transfer you 100 tokens. Soon, an army of GOEW enforcers will arrive and try to beat the shit out of you. I will do my best to defend you, but you're still gonna need to find words for how you're gonna apologize and defend yourself. "

"I think I see them in the distance. Shit, I wouldn't have done any of this if I knew Kate would turn on me. "

"Too late for regrets now. Let's see if you manage to get out of this unscathed."

The army arrives, with Vasiliy in front.

"Adrian, you're fucking busted. Any last words before we break all the bones in your body?"

"Nobody is breaking anyone's bones today. Adrian has been bottling up his emotions from his breakup with Lumina and today he broke down and decided to troll everyone in the lab. I will deal with him myself. Your assistance is not needed." - Vici told him, 2 ice balls in her hands.

"Look, guys, I am sorry. I lost track of what I was doing and suddenly I was making people cry and scream for no reason. Seriously."

Silence. "How are you going to deal with him yourself, Victoria? "

"I will fine him for 100 tokens. "

"Nooo dude, that's so much money, where am I gonna get any more for my cola?" - asks Adrian with fake sadness.

"I'll find you a way. You've been busy today, and you need to take responsibility for your actions. "

"Damn it. Hold on, I'll give you the tokens."

Adrian transfers Victoria 100 tokens and shows that he did to everyone.

"Can you give the organization a cut of that?"

"How about… no?" She said with mild sass in her voice.

"Well he better not try it again, unless he's making it obvious it's his doing. Come on, everyone." They walk away.

"I still have no idea why are you doing this after everything we've been through. You have no reason to help me, yet you're doing it anyway."

Victoria hugs him. "Because you've shown me that trusting someone in life isn't always a bad idea. Do take into account however that if you betray me, I will have you kidnapped and killed in the most painful manner possible and savor your dying screams of agony."

"I have no words for how amazing you are."

S1E13 Blessed Are The Peacemakers

Adrian is sitting in the block building way after everyone left for their playtime after classes. He is seen drawing depictions of himself dying in various ways. Suddenly, his teacher comes to him and tells him:

"Adrian, you've been bailed out. I hope you've learnt your lesson."

"I sure did! Have a good day. "

As he exits the block building, he sees that he has a dm from Vici: "Meet me at our usual place. I've got a problem."

When he comes around, she is sitting with her hands covering her face. He sits down and asks her:

"What's troubling you, Vici? I know you promised to only bail me out if you really need something. "

"I've been trying to repress it so hard because it's just such a bad idea on so many levels, but I can't stop thinking about her."

"Who?"

"That's the nasty part. It's Lumina."

"Okay? I would have expected higher chances of vampires invading our world and starting to kill us, to be perfectly honest. Just, wow. Holy shit. "

"No, you're right. But at the same time, she's so angry, so passionate, and just straight up… hot. "

"I really don't know what to say, I am gonna be honest. This is so unexpected."

"Don't worry about it. Your mind is thankfully not fucked enough yet to look at things from my perspective. However, I want you to come with me to where she's sitting all day long and… Try to make her feel better about both of us."

"Fuck, dude. Not her again." - Adrian said with extreme dread.

"It's okay, I can do it myself, if you don't want to."

"I mean, as much as I would hate to be exposed to her again, she is the strongest person who hates us. But we gotta do what we gotta do. Are you ready?" He puts his hand on her shoulder.

"As much as I will ever be. Thank you."

When they arrive to block 83, they see Lumina in the distance, sitting on her phone. But as they're approaching her, a couple of guys notice Victoria and come close.

"Oh you're here! Mind if I ask for your services?"

\*sigh\* "That's fine with me. Let's just get to the side here a little."

After they're done, as they approach Lumina, Victoria says:

"It's starting to get tiresome but the money will be all worth it."

When they finally arrive near Lumina, Vici begins. "Lumi? How are you? Are you okay?" Adrian waves her uncomfortably.

"What are you two shitfaces doing here?"

"We wanted to check on you. To see if you're okay, and to try to see if we can make you feel better somehow."

"Lumi, we seriously don't have to all hate eachother. Let's work out all our problems. " - Adrian suggests.

"The only way I am working out my problems with you two is if I give both of you third degree burns with my lasers, but you're just going to put me in an ice bubble if I try that again, is that it?"

"Lumina, please, listen to yourself. We're not your enemies. We don't want you to be hurt. We just want to help."

"Get away from me. "

"We tried our best. Let's go."

As they're walking back, Victoria is thinking aloud:

"Fuck. How am I meant to handle her? She is completely unapproachable."

"I am here to provide emotional support."

"Thank you."

Suddenly, they see a familiar figure on Vici's favorite bench. It's Bezdon, the void kid from the first episode.

"No way, they healed him back to normal?"

"Who- Whoa. I thought he was in jail."

"I shot him with a real gun I found in my house. They froze him in time because there was noone around to heal him back to normal, or there weren't enough resources, whatever. "

As they get close, they're greeted by Bezdon.

"Hey there. Didn't think to see both of you in one place. You guys are partners or something now?"

"No." - Victoria answered.

"God, I wish." - Adrian answered.

"Trust me, you don't." She puts her hand on his shoulder.

"How have you two been? Did you make the big bux, Vivi?"

"I did, to everyone's dismay."

"Wow. You've changed, you used to be a lot more melancholic and eternally sad."

"Still sort of am, but Adrian was my saving grace."

"Speaking of, how has your life been turning around?" - he asks, facing Adrian.

"Well, I stopped being the block's loser, and on top of that…"

"What?"

"The universe is a lie. Ancient egyptians ate cocaine for breakfast. Nicola Tesla was shitting coil magnets." - Adrian whispered to him using telepathy.

"Whoa. Not only all of that was complete nonsense, but I am pretty sure you just used telepathy on me. Awesome!"

"He got in SO much trouble when he first started experimenting with it. The entire lab was in an uproar."

"Super! Seems like my intervention did help."

Much later, in the evening, Vici and Adrian were playing something together inside. Suddenly, Victoria gets a call.

"Yes, Bezdon? Which one of us would win in a fight? I am not gonna lie, the thought did cross my mind. However, I really can't be arsed. Of course, alright. Bye. "

"Now that thought is crossing my mind too."

"Eh, I've got better things to do."

"What if we get one of the blocks to organize bets for this whole event and the winner would take something like 20% of those who made the wrong bet? "

"Now we're talking. Still not worth it."

Next day in the evening, Victoria and Adrian are hanging out as usual.

"I think I know what I have to do. I am gonna have to try again, but this time, with a flower,a real one, and then confess my feelings directly, without masking anything. "

"That's gonna be a lottery ticket of a lifetime. Good luck."

"Thank you." She takes his hand. "I know where to get biological flowers. They're not cheap, but our business is booming, so the rejection would hurt more than the waste of a flower."

"I mean, the worst she can say is no, right?"

"Probably the best she can say, but we'll just see what happens."

Cut to the duo approaching block 83 again, Vici with a flower behind her back. Lumina is seen in the same spot in the distance, still on her phone.

Victoria is mentally preparing herself by breathing deep. Adrian embraces her.

"Whatever happens, I am always on your side."

"Thanks for doing this for me. I'll start a phone call so you can hear the whole thing."

"Good luck."

She starts approaching Lumina, still with a flower behind her back.

"Great, you're here again. What are you gonna bother me about now?"

"Hey, Lumina. I just… Came to say… Will you go out on a date with me? " She pulls out the flower from her back.

Lumina is staring at her for a decent while, analyzing the situation. "You're fucking with me, right?"

"No. I seriously think I want you in my life. You're beautiful and… I like your personality."

"What the fuck do you think you're doing? How are you seriously suggesting me anything like this?"

"I am sure you have hidden layers to your personality. Come on, sister. We can be happy together."

"No, no, no, no, no. I refuse to believe you're genuine. You're just trying to weird me out because you're a sadistic piece of shit."

"I am a sadistic piece of shit, yes, but I swear to you, I am genuine!"

"Then why do you have ice balls in your hands?"

"Purely for self-defense."

"Fuck. You. Get out of here. "

She left without a word. Someone approached her with phone in hand. "I'd like a deep lip kiss."

She gives the customer a thumbs up. When they begin kissing, he pulls his mouth away shortly after the kiss starts because her mouth became ice cold due to her emotional distress. "Oh, I am sorry. "

"No, don't apologize, that was awesome! It's like death itself kissed me! Have a good evening!"

When she got back to Adrian, he said:

"I heard the whole thing. You okay?"

"I am fine. I don't know what I was expecting." - she said as if she was almost crying.

"You expected nothing, and it didn't happen. We're just gonna have to move on with our lives. Are you… crying?"

"I am not crying, you're crying." - she said, now overtly crying.

"It's okay. My mom told me: when a person is crying, it means their body is naturally letting all the bad emotions out. Cry all you need."

"I don't want to cry. I am the empress of frostbite and pain. Empresses don't cry."

"Yes, you are, but everyone has to cry sometimes. Except adult dudes, apparently."

"Why… Would she hate me so much? "

"Because she's a bitch of a human being. Come on, fuck her. Let's think of something else."

"You're right. Fuck her. Fuck everyone. " She starts gradually crying less. "I need to go and do something. I'll see you when I am done."

"Where are you going? " Adrian becomes mildly alarmed.

"Don't worry about it, homie. Please, don't think about me for one evening. " She embraces him.

"You know I can't do that. "

"Try." She walks away and starts typing something on her phone.

Cut to a random previously not mentioned block of 11 year olds, where several people are running inside the block building, while everyone else is preparing themselves for combat. Eventually, Victoria comes around and annihilates the entire chunk of 14 defending soldiers with her deadly shattering ice balls. The block leader pulls out 2 small planter pots to put in each hand, and turns one of them into a giant shield made out of an amalgamation of overgrown flowers. He is dressed in a desaturated green shirt and jeans. Victoria throws an ice ball grenade into him and a shattering ice ball above him, so he is not able to block both attacks at the same time, which works and he is instantly knocked down. She puts some ice dust inside his shirt and leaves, typing on her phone something again. This time, a block she arrives at is fully deserted. The only person standing there is Adrian.

"Vici, please, stop! What are you doing?"

"Why did I know this was going to happen… Look. I'm not feeling great, and I need to annihilate a few blocks to make me feel better. It's the best coping mechanism I have. Don't interfere."

"Defeating more blocks won't solve anything. You're simply dealing with the symptoms instead of solving the root of the problem."

"And what's the root of the problem? "

Silence. "Look, I just don't want you to hurt anyone else, okay? Before you get to anyone else, you're gonna have to get through me, first."

"If I do get through you, will we stop being friends?"

"No, as long as I don't get any more ice in my clothes."

"Then show me what you've got."

Victoria starts running towards Adrian. In the meantime, he starts running away and blocking all her attacks without attacking himself directly while still staying on the block perimeter. "\*sex sounds\* Those are the sounds you're gonna be making when you turn 14." - Adrian telepathically projects onto Vici.

"That's not gonna work, homie. I am a grandmaster of manipulation, you're just an apprentice."

Adrian pulls out his phone and starts reading 50 shades of gray to Victoria through telepathy. "You think that's disgusting? I've consumed worse. Try again."

Adrian starts whispering, "Victoria, it's your body. I am really tired of blasting people with shattering ice balls. Can I get a little timeout for the rest of the evening?"

"It really loses all of its effectiveness if the target knows it's you. Try something else."

"Oh, don't worry. I wasn't actually trying to hurt my best and only friend. I was just dragging time till the reinforcements arrived."

"You know you can't stop me even with the reinforcements, right?"

"I bet I can."

Vasiliy suddenly appears. He pretends to be in a combat stance and starts approaching Victoria.

"You know neither of you two have any physical attacks and that I am immune to all your mental attacks, right? How do you-" Vasiliy starts enhancing Victoria's mood with his powers."Oh, I see what you've been trying to do, you wanted to give me a mood boost. Well, I can assure you it's- okay, holy shit, this feels amazing. That's just what I needed. " At some point while she is saying this, she stops chasing Adrian and pulls away her ice balls. Adrian sprints at her and embraces her.

"Welcome back."

"Hey, if you ever feel like going on a rampage through the lab again, give me a call. I know this is completely legal and ethical both by adult and our rules, but also, come on. That's not nice." - Vasiliy explains.

"Thank you. Both of you."

"You know, you could invest all that angst into fighting with Bezdon. How do you feel about calling him and getting the whole fight arranged?"

"May aswell. I mean, what if I win and get absolutely enormous cash as a reward? "

She calls Bezdon on the phone.

In 3 days, a large crowd is standing somewhere, overlooking Victoria in her serious combat clothes with big ice balls in each hand standing against Bezdon, with all 4 of his void tentacles facing his opponent.

"On the left side we have Victoria, the one woman army, who annihilated an entire block the other day just because she was in a bad mood, who terrorized everyone and everything with her hailstorms ever since she got her powers! On the right side we have Bezdon, the undefeated fighter, the master of tentacles as black as night, filled to the brim with might! And now, the two will fight eachother, so we can find out who is the strongest kid in the lab! Ready! Set! Fight!" - the host cries.

Victoria starts circling around Bezdon, launching 2 ice ball grenades at him, then 2 shattering ice balls. He successfully manages to smack the grenades mid air before they can reach his body, but the shattering ice balls do manage to land and deal minor damage to Bezdon. At the same time, he uses his bottom tentacles to smack Victoria's feet from both sides to make her fall to the ground, which she manages to jump over. Then, Bezdon swings all 4 of his tentacles at Victoria at various parts of her body, and at the same time she dashes towards him and throws 2 shattering ice balls at him mid air. The tentacles mostly miss, but manage to land behind Victoria's back, pushing her forward and nearly knocking her off balance, while the ice shards hit Bezdon straight in the face, staggering him for a decent while and making him cover his face with his hands. The commentator tries to narrate the fight, but realizes everything is way too fast for him to be able to keep up, so he gives up and says these two are on another level. Victoria starts preparing more shattering ice balls, but before she can throw them, Bezdon pokes her in the back with full force with all 4 of his void tentacles, which succeeds and makes her land right into him. She starts groaning, but with the remainder of her strength, she transforms her ice balls to form an icy mold around Bezdon's neck, causing him to scream in pain and fall onto the ground. As the void tentacles start retracting back into Bezdon's back, Vici also falls onto the ground right next to her opponent at the same time as him.

"Ladies and gentlemen, it's a tie! Holy fuck, dude." - the commentator says. Victoria melts off the ice off of Bezdon's neck.

"I won! I actually won somehow by betting that it'd be a tie!" - one random guy says. The guy gets lynched afterwards. In the meantime, Adrian gets on stage and approaches Victoria, who is too hurt to stand.

"How are you feeling?"

"I've been better, but I am not thinking about Lumina, so that's a win."

S1E14 Unspeakable Images

Adrian and Victoria are sitting on their usual bench.

"Adrian, the GOEW has received secret reports that there have been troublemakers who assault other blocks then take screenshots of the private parts of their defeated opponents. I know your learning process for your telepathy has been stalled because of the immense amount of heat you got when you first started fucking around with your new powers, but we're facing a block that did something so vile, so horrible, that nobody will object to using your final way to disturb a child's mind. It's time we continue our training. "

"Is this about reading that insane text you've been writing for a while now?"

"I completely forgot about that. Here's the whole thing written in text if you ever need it when your phone isn't available, and I'll send you a dm with the same text, but I was actually talking about something much, much worse."

"Well, I won't get stronger if I don't agree, so let's do this. "

"Perfect. I am gonna show you a video from my phone. Brace yourself, what you're about to see is going to be truly disturbing." She starts showing him the video.

"It can't be that bad, I mean if it's anything like the 50 shades then… Whoa. These are huge. And what the hell is wrong with those guys' dicks, do all teens walk around with dicks as big as that usually? "

"Um, no, but that's not the point. It gets worse."

"What the fuck are they doing? That's disgusting. Ew. Why is he spinning his dick facing the camera for some reason? Bro. BRO. Why would he pee on, whatever is that that girl got between her legs? I can't watch anymore, that's so horrible, how do I unsee what I just saw?"

"I warned you it would be nasty. Imagine how amazingly it would work against your opponents."

Adrian stands up, walks away a little and pukes on the ground. "Holy fuck, do you have any water?"

"I do, actually, here." She pulls out a big bottle from under her bench.

He drinks some water and flushes his mouth with it, then starts taking deep breaths. "Okay. Oooookay. I think… I can handle this, but I have so many questions. "

"I understand. Now that I think of it, we should have been doing this a little slower so you can better comprehend what's going on to avoid your head getting overwhelmed by all that's happening like I am assuming it just did."

"Maybe… It's not too late. We can do this. With some effort. "

"Also, if it turns out that I just gave you your childhood trauma, please don't abandon me. You mean so much to me. I am sorry for not taking more precautions before doing this."

"I honestly don't even know what are you apologizing about anymore. Let's get back to the task at hand. First of all, why the fuck are their dicks so big?"

Later:

"So what you're saying is, it's sort of like playing during sex and if you ignore how disgusting it is it's as simple as that?"

"That's right. Sometimes, I feel like some people like some things not despite how disgusting are they, but because of how disgusting are they. Kinks are like food, there's so many varieties of them."

"Okay. Does a nose kink exist? "

"Yea, from what I've been told it used to be very widespread in the 50's."

"What about the feet kink?"

"That's an old classic. "

"Okay, that's enough of that. Let's get back to it."

Later, when Adrian is sleeping, he looks visibly stressed, then he produces a very loud scream which is heard across his entire house. His parents come around and ask him: "What happened, Adrian? "

"I saw a naked dude squeeze on a naked woman's tits, which caused them to blast the man with cum. Then she shat into the man's ass, and they were all laughing, and then Lumina's eye lasers appeared out of nowhere and killed them both."

"Where did you get the fragments from where to assemble this mental image?"

"I can't say. "

"Please. It's important for us to know how can we help you."

"Lumina. Anyway, I need to get back to sleep. Good night."

Next day during the first school break, Adrian arrives at Victoria's bench looking sad, and sits down, grabbing his head with his hands.

"Morning, Adrian, are you okay?"

"Hey, I am alright, just didn't sleep well is all. And my head hurts. And I just wanna lie down and do nothing. It's like I am off my meds."

Vici covers her face with hands. "Oh for fuck's sake. This is so, so bad. I had no idea how hard my tiny mishap from yesterday would blow up in my face. In our faces. "

"Damn it… What do we do now?"

"Vasiliy could help. We could see what's happening to your mood. "

"Let's go pay him a visit."

Cut to the duo and Vasiliy standing somewhere talking.

"Let's see…"

After a pretty decent chunk of time passes, Adrian says, "Hey, I am back to normal. Thanks for fixing me."

"I am not actually sure I fixed you. I have never had this much struggle to raise someone's mood, and it was raising your mood to neutral, not happy. What happened?"

"We can't say. You wouldn't wanna know anyway." - Victoria replied.

"This is seriously disturbing. You really should see adults about this probably. I don't know how much I can do."

"Can't tell them either."

"I'll do the best I can to help you, but I'd still recommend finding a way to present the problem to the adults."

"Thank you, Vasiliy."

Victoria and Adrian are walking to a block that hasn't been mentioned before.

"You sure you wanna do this, Adrian? You've been exposed to some nasty stuff."

"I am sure. Let's do this."

When they get close, Victoria types in the command to the GOEW attack force to surround the block from all sides other than the one Victoria and Adrian are approaching from. Vici begins annihilating her opponents with shattering ice balls, while Adrian is seen focusing his telepathy on stragglers, who begin puking, screaming, and sometimes cowering. After everyone has been incapacitated, the GOEW attackers begin taking everyone's phones before they can delete anything. Several adults come out of the block building and begin checking phones of kids for explicit pictures one by one.

Next day after first school lesson, Adrian comes to Victoria's bench and lies down on it, his head facing towards Victoria.

"Didn't sleep again last night?"

"It was better this time. Just feeling generally fatigued, I wanna lie down in bed and do nothing. I have different headaches this time, it's almost like I overdosed on my meds."

"Shit, it's getting worse. We really might have to involve adults in this, I'll start thinking how are you gonna justify having mental images of hardcore porn in your head. Sit tight, Adrian, we're getting you out of this. " - she gives Adrian a few sweet pets.

Vasiliy comes around. "Morning guys, how's Adrian?"

"Worse. He only wants to lie down now."

"Let me try fixing this. \*delay\* Better?"

"The headache is gone, still don't wanna do anything and lie down. " - Adrian replies.

"I have an idea. Try to sit down and see if anything changes."

He complies. "Head hurty. Wanna lie back down."

"Yea, he really needs to be in bed right now before it gets worse. "

Cut to Adrian lying in doctor's office face upwards, with Victoria and the doctor talking about something.

"This kid's mind has been damaged to the most severe degree I have ever seen. He has suffered a variety of traumas and abuse, some of which include juvenile exposure to pornography, a bad trip from psychedelic rainbow gas and abuse from his girlfriend. I think you had some hand in his poor mental state aswell."

"It's true. We weren't always on such amazing terms with eachother."

"I will see if we can help him somehow. He's going to need several years of therapy to recover, but perhaps more meds can ease his pain."

Next morning, Adrian is not getting up. His dad comes in and asks him, "How are you feeling, son?"

"Bad." He replies in the most dead inside tone possible.

"Do you want something that can help you?"

"I don't know. Vasiliy. Food."

"Vasiliy? Why him?"

"He make head feel better."

"Oh no, I think that's the child with the powers to make a person happy temporarily. I am guessing you received such a big dose of his power that you've become addicted to it?"

"I guess."

"Fuck."

Later, the block doctor is seen visiting Adrian in his room.

"So how did you get exposed to such nasty material at such a young age?"

Adrian reads a message from Vici from his phone. "Me and Sofia have decided to throw Sofia's ex boyfriend under the bus because he offered a different girl to be friends when they were still dating. When asked how did you get exposed to the porn, say you bought the video from Brian from block B0098."

"Bought it from Brian. Block B0098."

3 weeks start passing by. Victoria is shown to revert back to her melancholic state, doing everything she normally does with zero enthusiasm. Occasionally, she's seen visiting Adrian in his room, with him looking emotionally numb and her looking like she's talking to a dying grandpa.

Eventually, an unknown professor looking adult enters his room along with his parents. Adrian is seen watching something in his phone, marking significant improvement in his mental state.

"Adrian, I want you to meet Dr. Hästkuk. He is here to try to use the magic of the latest medicine to resolve your destroyed mental state. " - his mom opens.

"Hello, Adrian. I've been told everything that has been afflicting you for the last several weeks. I am really sorry for you, it's inconceivable how a child can suffer so much mental trauma at a young age. "

"Can we get to the point, doctor? I appreciate your pity but it doesn't exactly help. "

"Adrian, be nice to the good doctor." - his dad requests.

"It's alright, depressed people tend to be a lot easier to irritate. It's only natural. What you need to do is to put on this helmet, plug the device connected to the helmet to the nearest socket, and drink from this vial I have for you. "

"Alright."

All 3 adults connect the helmet to the socket, followed by Adrian consuming weird liquid in the vial. The helmet visually looks like it's meant to zap the wearer with electric shocks, but Adrian is obviously too young to know that.

Adrian begins feeling sleepy.

"Whoa. I hope you guys know if you just killed me, you won't remain alive for long."

"Why would we do that? The point is to transport you into a lucid dream where you will be metaphorically physically fighting your demons."

"Oh it's rainbow gas 2.0."

"What does he mean by rainbow gas?"

"Doctor, we told you about about that bad trip he had a while ago. Rainbow gas-

Adrian falls asleep. The dream begins, and he stands in the middle of the road between a couple of blocks. The sun is dim and grey, the blocks themselves look old and abandoned, with some being crumbled, others being completely replaced with rubble. He walks around a little bit, until a figure drops down from the sun. It turns around and reveals itself to be Lumina. She is smiling.

"Hello, Adrian! Remember me?" - she says in a sweet, normal voice.

"Too well."

Her neck stretches out from her body, moving her head from it near Adrian's face, and at the same time she grows large monstrous teeth, her eyes begin glowing yellow, and skull tattoos appear on her cheeks. Her voice becomes monstrous. The sky becomes a lot brighter and more saturated aswell. "Too well? What do you mean, too well, you traitorous cuntling? We had something, you and me, and all you had to do is not fucking betray me and fight me with your worst enemy side by side! Fuck you and your stupid ugly fucking face!"

Adrian is properly scared. "You were going off course, Lumi. I needed to do something about your overly obsessive ass."

"You still don't fucking understand you absolute dickface! What I say, goes! I am superior to you and you will do as I say! Look above you. These are my strings. I control you. You're a puppet. You can't fight it. So embrace it and be my slave for all eternity while I conquer the world! Ah hah hah hah hah hah hah haaa!"

Adrian tries to cut the strings with his ice sword. However, the blade is not actually sharp and his attempts are completely fruitless.

"That blade is as dull as your brain! You will never be able to escape my grasp!"

"The real Lumina wouldn't do anything you're doing, you know. She is sitting on her phone all day, without any energy and/or desire to fight anyone. "

"Oh that's where you're WRONG. She is meticulously preparing her revenge, and she will burn your entire body so hard you're going to be known as Darth Dickhead for the rest of your life! And your precious Victoria won't be there to save you!"

Adrian starts telepathically whispering into Lumina's mind. "You can't run from your insecurities, Lumina. There's more to life than anger and murder."

Lumina grabs Adrian's light strings with her right hand by stretching it out very far just like her neck, and raises Adrian up into the air with them. "Silence! Bow down to me or face my insufferable verbal abuse!"

Adrian begins trying to think how to defeat dream Lumina. Suddenly, snow begins falling, the ground slowly turns to white, the skies become white. "You idiot. You spent so long trying to defeat me, that your next nightmare came around. Now we will both be kicking your ass!"

Dream Victoria approaches. She looks exactly the same as in the real world, but much taller and with a crown of ice. "Not really. However, if you pay me 2147longnumber tokens, that can be arranged, Lumi. " Her voice is melancholic and emotionless. Dream Lumina retracts her head back to her body.

"Sure thing, one sec." She begins transferring the tokens.

"Victoria, you know we're friends in the outside world by this point, right?" - Adrian asks.

"So why would that stop me from shoving some ice down your clothes? Here's another good one, I could shove an ice rod up your anus. I could also make you swallow an ice ball and explode it from the inside. Pick your poison, dickface."

"Because that won't hurt me. Victoria is my favorite person in the world, and I could not know when would be the end of things that make her as awesome as she is. Try it. Throw your shattering ice ball at me, let me prove my point."

Dream Victoria throws a shattering ice ball at Adrian. He opens his mouth and closes his eyes. The shards hit him and create several small wounds, with a couple landing in his mouth. He swallows them.

"What are you doing?"

"There, Victoria, I transferred you the tokens. Oh shit, did I miss something?"

"Vici, I told you, I idolize you. Your ice doesn't hurt me, it only makes me feel better and more content with myself."

"You're kind of a freak, you know that?" - Dream Victoria remarks in surprise. Dream Lumina is staring at Adrian with her mouth open.

"So what? Listen, Victoria. We're allies in this dimension, whenever you like it or not. You can join my side and help me complete my purpose, or you can get sent straight into the dark oblivion of nonexistence."

"He's fucking bluffing, Victoria! You're being brainwashed! He won't send you anywhere!"

"At least he's learning to be strong." Dream Victoria pulls out a giant ball of ice from behind her back, and throws it with her full might at Dream Lumina as an ice ball grenade. It shatters, knocking her back a good distance and making her lose grip of Adrian's light strings. He falls to the ground and stands up. Dream Victoria walks close to Dream Lumina and throws one extra shattering ice ball at her face. "Consider your tokens refunded."

"Kill… Them all…" Dream Lumina turns into black smoke and fades away.

"Thanks for saving me, Vici."

"You're welcome."

Adrian approaches her. "Hey, mind if I ask what kind of a being are you?"

"I am a manifestation of your memories about the real Victoria. Your subconsciousness has decided what I manifested myself like. "

"Can my subconsciousness manifest you kissing me on the lips too?"

"You're a loser, Adrian. Barely better than any average dweller of this lab. You don't deserve being kissed by a lady as fine as Victoria."

"Yea, you're right."

"Why is there a giant flying penis in the sky?"

"Yea, it's probably a manifestation of my latest nightmare. Can't see it, though."

"I bet I've been exposed to worse."

"I bet you weren't."

Suddenly, a loud squirting sound is heard, and an orgy of teens comes crashing down from the skies. They're all wearing black squares around their private parts, and their feet.

"I don't remember them wearing black squares. What is this?"

The teens get in a line and each fire a ray of piss at Adrian. He pulls out his ice shield and blocks them all, which are conveniently aimed at the same spot. He looks to the side and sees Dream Victoria sucking up snow all around her into a giant snowball above her head, then launching it into the teens, burying them under the snow instantly. Shortly after, black smoke comes out from beneath the snow. "I really don't think this is how you're meant to do this."

"Well, as long as it works."

"Try to handle the next one on your own."

"Fine." - he answered in a defeated tone.

The ground starts shaking and a hole beneath begins forming. From there, Dream Bezdon crawls out. The day turns to night and a full moon takes place the place of the sun, providing twilight to the dream.

"You again, Bezdon? Do you know how much physical pain I have gone through ever since I was born? I am numb to it. Go ahead, give it your best shot. "

Dream Bezdon grabs Adrian's limbs with his void tentacles and begins drawing and quartering him.

Adrian feels some pain, which he promptly ignores. "Go ahead. Keep trying. You don't scare me."

After some time, Dream Bezdon slams Adrian into the ground with his tentacles. "Sticks and swords may break my bones, but I'll come back healthy in merely half a week. You're wasting your time."

Dream Bezdon continues smacking him against the ground. "Alright, that's enough." Adrian starts projecting porn into Dream Bezdon's brain, which causes him to lose his tentacles' grip on Adrian and to collapse on his knees. Dream Victoria jumps close and gives Adrian another ice sword, this time with sharp edges. He takes it, runs up to Dream Bezdon, grabs him by his hair and thrusts the sword into his neck, causing him to turn into black smoke. The hole in the ground he came out of closes all by itself.

"You figured it out. The key is being able to stand up for yourself, not being able to endure pain, even if that does help."

"So I guess this is it then?"

"I am getting a feeling it isn't."

An army of kids is approaching the duo from afar with their swords drawn.

"That's a big assault force."

"Hey, Vici, you know that one show where the characters dance and stuff and manage to fuse into one being with the combined power of both?"

"I am a part of you, of course I know it, stupid."

"Let's do it."

She thinks for a second. "Sure."

Adrian starts dancing weirdly in a style he invented himself. Dream Victoria starts slowly dancing while looking face down all the way. Eventually they connect hands and fuse into an adult with Adrian's shirt and Victoria's lower part, with the face of this new being combining traits of both.

"Fear the wrath of Adrictoria!" - they say in a voice compound of both of the voices of the original children.

As the army of kids starts getting close, Adrictroria charges up for a moment and fires a frost beam from their forehead at the approaching kids, causing them to fall on the ground, freezing and terrified of the unspeakable images they've received in their heads. In only a few seconds, everyone is down.

"It's over, Adrictoria. We won. Perhaps our alliance and our mere existence was not at all what Adrian was meant to accomplish, but we're rolling with it anyway. Until next time, myself. "

Adrian wakes up in his room, his parents and the doctor still there. He looks at his hands, sees they're his. He picks up a bit of saliva from his mouth and tries to freeze it with his mind, but fails.

"Welcome back, Adrian. Did you succeed?"

"Yes. We did it. I think I feel noticeably better already. "

"What do you mean by we?"

"We, as in, me and Victoria from the dream. We handled the nightmares together, then became Adrictroria together. "

"Hold on. You teamed up with a trauma of yours to defeat your other traumas? "

"That's right."

"I have never seen anything of the sort. I'll be interested to see what happens next."

Cut to Adrian leaving the block building. The boys who share his parents notice him and come close.

"Oh my god, is that Adrian walking around without any hints of depression?"

"Wow, welcome back, dude!"

"Hey guys." He waves at them and goes towards Victoria's remote bench. When she notices him approaching, she instantly stands up and dashes to embrace him.

"I am guessing it happened and it was all successful?"

"That's right. Let's sit down so I can tell you all about it."

Some time later:

"That sounds awesome, even if moderately disturbing how you actually feel about me. But you seem better, so I guess we can all go back to normal. I wish it was as easy for me to deal with my traumas as it was for you, honestly."

"Whoa, you have some too?"

She smiles. "There's still so much you don't know about me. "

"Yea. Mind if you ask you something?"

"Go ahead."

"Have you ever thought of me as a partner? A potential one."

"Hmmm… No. But I wouldn't mind trying it out later. Right now, I really don't have any friends I would trust with counsel for relationship issues, and there are still things you don't know about me, which I would like you to find out organically over time. Once these problems are resolved, we'll be ready to proceed."

"What about Sofia?"

"We're more business partners than friends. I don't trust my actual partners in the kissing business either, I haven't really connected with any of them in the same way as we did."

"Your parents?"

"They're boring and negligent and they don't help me grapple with life's difficulties for shit."

"What if we don't have any problems?"

"Oh, you sweet summer child. All relationships have problems. Every single one. It all depends on how the partners handle such problems. Nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes. Also, just a friendly word of warning: if you end up betraying my trust in any way in the future, the adults are gonna have to clean up a ton of bloody chunks from the pavement. Bloody chunks which used to be you. Are we clear?" - she grinned at Adrian. He shrugged and gave her a thumbs up. "And ignore me asking Lumina out. It was an impulsive, stupid decision and there was no way we would have lasted 3 days in best case scenario."

S1E15 A Luxury We Can't Afford

Everyone in block 85 is sitting inside during a class, with visible anticipation of being able to go outside.

"Students, we have a lab wide announcement for all of you. In exactly one week everyone will begin a game: 3 of you all across the lab will be chosen to acquire a shard of an ornate silver coin each. The first person to deliver all 3 shards of the coin to their parents or their teacher will be awarded 500 tokens and their entire block will be awarded 100."

The class begins cheering.

"This is gonna be awesome!"

"We have 3 members with strong powers, nobody will stand a chance!"

"I mean, it depends if Victoria is in. Are we playing, ma'am?" - Nathan asks.

"Fuck yea we are."

The class begins cheering again.

"Now, now, students, there is one extra rule. You always have to have the shards on you when you're outside. We have a security system which tracks all of your locations aswell as the coin's location, and if we notice any inconsistencies you will have your shard taken away and given to a completely random block. Are we clear on that?"

"Yes." - everyone says.

"What is it, Victoria?" - the teacher asks, seeing that she raised her hand up.

Victoria comes near the blackboard. "Dear classmates. This might be a simple game the adults have prepared for us for the purpose of us having fun and pursuing strength, however, there's something much greater at stake here. I know a way we could all change our lives forever after this event is over. I know there's a couple of you who aren't keen on combat at all, but trust me, you have something to gain from this too. I will explain everything in detail during a meeting later, which I will announce in the group chat of the block. Thank you. " The teacher looks confused as to what is she talking about. The class begins cheering again, although a lot quieter this time.

After the class is over, Adrian asks her:

"What were you talking about back there, unless it's a secret or something?"

"It is a secret, but I'll tell you anyway, since I want you to be a part of that meeting I was mentioning. Basically, I am very close to hitting the record high of 20 thousand tokens, and if we win and everyone donates their earnings to me, then we will be complete and the outside world shall be ours. This can be the final battle on the path to something beautiful. "

"I don't know if everyone will be able to trust you. I mean, you could keep our entire block hostage and extort the tokens anyway, but I mean, are we really gonna do that?"

"We will just have to try and hope people resonate with this idea. This whole thing is starting at a very unfortunate time, however. The GOEW has received a secret report about a teacher undressing an 8 year old girl and touching her inappropriately, claiming she might be in danger and he's checking something."

"What if she is?"

Vici facepalms. "Adrian. God. Damn it. He's a pedo. He is a teacher, not a doctor, that excuse is very clearly a lie to cover up what he's doing."

"Oh wow. But aren't we gonna get punished for fighting an adult? "

"Not sure. Don't care. This is personal and he is going down. The only question is, are you in?"

"I always have your back, Vici."

"Good. There's a kid with powers of invisibility that we desperately need to catch the pedo red handed. Can you go to block 64 and fill him in on this? He dresses like a ninja. I need to stay here and prepare a speech for the upcoming meeting."

"Yes, Ma'am." He salutes her.

"Go fuck yourself." - she says with a smile.

"You know I am too young to do something like that. "

"Well, technically…"

"Nope, I am going. Goodbye."

He later arrives to block 64 and locates the target, who is standing against a wall, sitting on his phone. He is wearing all black clothes, covering every single part of his skin, other than his eyes, aswell as a red tie around his waist.

"Hey, are you the kid with invisibility powers?"

"Gabriel from block 64 at your service, if you have the cash. 50 tokens and I am all yours, 25 if it's something minor."

"Well, it's not minor, but it does involve minors. Me and my friend need to catch a pedophile and bring him to justice."

"Well why didn't you say so? Come on, let's formulate a plan."

Back to Victoria's bench. Gabriel and the duo are discussing the plan for how to get the job done.

"So as long as you have enough sugar in your blood, you can remain completely invisible for forever?" - Adrian asks.

"Yes. All I need to last until the end of the job is a bar of milk or white chocolate and a couple of sandwiches in case this will take a while. "

"Then we'll buy you some." - says Victoria.

"Hey, it's no trouble. I'll buy some myself."

"No objections. Let me bring you to my parents so you can buy that bar of chocolate and those sandwiches."

As they're walking towards their target block, Victoria asks:

"Does everyone remember the plan?"

"I stand behind the door and wait for the teacher to leave the block building and then activate invisibility and follow him wherever he goes, quietly unlock any door on the way to where he is going, let you know where he is, and videotape as much as possible of what he is doing, and when I get enough incriminating footage, I call you and then don't get caught up in the fight afterwards. "

"Yep, meanwhile we hide behind a corner so we don't attract any attention, then when we receive a message of where he's going, we go inside the block building near where it's happening and wait for the phone call to signal us that it's time to barge in and kick his ass. " - Adrian recites.

"Perfect. We're ready."

The trio take their positions around the block in question, the block 69. Gabriel starts standing with an opened bar of chocolate in one hand and a phone in the other, and eventually he sits down. Meanwhile Victoria and Adrian are sitting around the corner and sitting on their phones. Eventually, Adrian asks:

"I was thinking. Why can't we just confront the teacher about what he's doing so he stops?"

"That isn't going to work for several reasons. First, if we try that, he will either deny it outright or claim that okay, he won't do it anymore, then find a way to do it sneakily in a way so nobody can find out about it, or just take a break from those atrocities for a few months to let off the heat and continue them when the heat is gone. Second, as long as we have no direct proof he did it, he's perfectly safe to suffer minimum consequences and just keep doing what he was doing before."

"How do you know this much about pedoes, again?"

She sighs. "You remember Mr. Krovoslawsky, right?"

"Yea, he taught us our entire childhood until some scandal 4 or 5 years ago got him transferred away after which he was never seen again."

"Do you remember which scandal was that?"

"Nope. What, did he fuck someone in our class and then denied everything?"

"That's right. And that person was an innocent, sweet little girl named… Me."

"No. Way. "

"I'll spare you the disturbing details of what happened to my private parts as a result, but…"

"You know you left very little to the imagination there, right? Fuck, dude. I am sorry, that sounds vile. " - he answered with audible disgust.

"Well, at least I gave you that mental image not before traumatizing you with hardcore porn. As I was saying, Krovoslawsky got transferred to a different lab and nothing happened to him, while I became the public enemy number one of our class, with all the worthless piece of shit feces which I told myself were my friends abandoning me for getting rid of everyone's favorite teacher. At least, I realized two big truths: that I never had any friends, and that the world sucks and the only way to move up is to jump on others' heads."

"I don't know, I never liked him in the first place. I always felt like he was too invasive about our lives. I am so sorry."

"Well, he certainly wasn't afraid to invade my private life, that's for sure."

Silence. Adrian covers his mouth with his hand. "I really didn't mean to upset you."

"Oh, come on, don't be sorry. People with depression tend to use dark humor to make fun of their own problems, it helps us keep up a positive outlook on things even if everything clearly sucks and it seems like there's no way out. You can laugh if you want. "

"I understand, but I hope you can forgive me if I don't laugh. "

She gives Adrian a few friendly head scratches. "Of course I will. You probably just don't understand the concept that well. Try it, pick a random trauma of yours and make a dark joke around it. "

"Uhhhh… He could traumatize others with no problem, but couldn't protect himself from the same fate."

"You're getting there. How about this one: what's common between Adrian after tripping on rainbow gas and a child of a man and a goat?"

"What?"

"They both wanted to die more than anything in the world."

Adrian begins wheezing and laughing uncontrollably.

"Now you get it."

Adrian couldn't answer as he was dying from laughter.

"I'd like to see you try one on me."

"Ah, holy shit. I will, as long as you hit me with another one afterwards. "

"Deal."

"Okay, okay. Victoria wanted to go ahead and make a deal with the devil. You know how it went? She got rejected. "

She produced a very slight giggle.

"Did you just… Laugh? Ho-ly shit."

"I suppose I did. Anyway, my turn: ..."

They're seen talking to eachother, with Adrian laughing very deeply and Victoria still making small giggles. Eventually, the time turns to near bedtime. The duo stand up and start walking home.

"Shit, he didn't come out. "

"Maybe he wasn't gonna do it today at all." - Adrian suggests.

"He also could have spotted us and realized he is being investigated. Hey, Gabe, we are done for the day."

"Well, we tried. What do we do now? " - he asks.

"We can think about that before going to sleep."

Next morning, the duo sit on their usual bench.

"Got any ideas what do we do now?"

"I guess we keep going to the block and keeping watch every time after classes until we catch his ass. "

"Whoa. Look at this."

"Mmm?"

In the GOEW group chat, a message says, "Another girl anonymously reported being undressed and touched by a teacher yesterday during the second break from school. Victoria, how is the case going?"

"He's still on the loose, he's just choosing the perfect times to do the deed to avoid our investigation. How are we supposed to catch him now?" - Victoria asks in mild sadness.

"I think we have no choice but to get either our teacher or our parents to excuse us from school. That's the only way we would be able to catch him on time."

"Shit, seems like we have no choice. The question is, do we ask the teacher or do we ask the parents? I say our parents since our teacher might have some solidarity for other teachers."

"Yea, it wouldn't surprise me if he did. I'll go first."

"Good luck. Thanks for doing this for me."

"I do what I must." He rings his mom.

"Yes, honey?"

"Mom, we have a problem. Can you please not share this with any teachers?"

"Of course, what's the problem?"

Adrian begins loudly whispering. "We have several reports of a specific teacher, not from our block, undressing little girls and more. We had a plan to catch him in the act, but it seems he can be active at any hour of the day, which is why I need to be excused from school, to catch the motherfucker. "

"Oh, wow. Me and Dad can arrange that for you and your friends, but we'll ground you for 3 days if it turns out that you were lying to me. Does that work? "

"Yes, thank you. The other members of the operation are Victoria from B0085 and Gabriel from… What was it again, Vici?"

"64."

"Gabriel from block B0064."

"Thank you, Adrian. Good luck on your mission!"

"Thanks, mom. Love you. Can you also bring us enough food to last us until the end of the day without the teacher noticing? And also can you make sure we can use our phones while everyone else has classes today?"

"Of course, son, will do."

Next, the trio are shown to be back in positions. There are 8 year olds outside, playing, practicing and talking. In the meantime, Victoria is shown showing off her new ice balls with handles to Adrian.

"Nice. Are they any better than ice balls?"

"They should be. The handle should make it so I can throw them further and more accurately. I will call them 'ice maracas'. But it's not for this mission since we will most likely be fighting in close quarters."

"Still cool that you're improving your gear."

"You know what would be my next objective after escaping from this place?"

"What?"

"I will find Marek Krovoslawsky and peg him so hard he will cry like a baby with a sex toy made out of pure ice, and when he can no longer remain conscious from the immense amount of pain I will inflict on him, I will hide him in a basement where no one will ever look for him, gag his mouth, tie him up and let him starve to death as he reflects on the biggest mistake of his life."

Adrian's eyes widen, but he refuses to challenge Victoria's goal out of fear. "Remind me not to fuck with you."

"Oh you can do that, but only as long as I agree to it prior. Which I won't, but still."

"I forgot the word "fuck" also has that meaning. Now I feel gross."

"Channel your grossing out into anger. Because if there's anyone that deserves it in this world, it's the camazonface we're hunting right now."

Gabriel's point of view is shown. The teacher opens the door outside and walks out. Gabriel notices that it's him, finally bites off a piece of chocolate and goes invisible. The teacher turns around to lock the door for a moment, walks up to a random girl, tells her something, looking like he is alarmed about something, then takes her hand and leads her inside. Gabriel follows them in. The teacher closes and locks the door from inside, but then the door is seen being unlocked very quietly by itself. The teacher leads the girl into a door to the staff room under the staircase, and closes the door again. Gabriel follows them, quietly unlocks the door, then places himself in the corner and messages Victoria where they are, and starts recording what's happening.

"So the first thing I need you to do is for you to strip completely naked."

"Mr. Mollystern, what is going on?"

"There's a very high chance you're infected with a deadly virus and that is the only way for me to properly check if you do." Gabriel looks severely disgusted.

Cut to Adrian and Victoria still sitting on the ground and talking.

"So it's basically a huge race, and the winner gets to become a human being- He is in, let's move. " She bolts up, grabs Adrian's hand and they both sprint near the door, quietly open it, sneak to the maintenance room and take their positions. Victoria goes near a sink, puts an ice ball into her hand and starts pouring water on her other arm in a way so said water slides down her arm onto the ice ball, increasing the ice ball in size.

Back inside the maintenance room. Gabriel is shown to have his eyes completely closed, but he can still hear everything.

"I am afraid it's true, you do have the virus. However, I have the vaccine against it right here." A zipper is heard being unzipped.

"Ew!"

"I know, sweetheart. All you need to do is to-"

Gabriel pulls down his headwear so he can puke not through his clothes, turns to the side and pukes right on the ground, being unable to help but to be very loud at the same time.

The teacher turns his head to the sound. "What was that?"

Some of the puke is seen lying on the floor, but otherwise Gabriel is still completely invisible.

"How did a student get into the classroom before the break is over? Either way, we need to finish what we started. "

Victoria is seen with 2 giant ice balls with handles, one on the ground and one in her left hand. She receives a message of "I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE I GOT PLENTY ENOUGH FOOTAGE KICK HIS ASS BEFORE I FIND MYSELF SOMETHING SHARP AND STAB MYSELF", to which she pulls away her phone, picks up the other giant ice ball and whispers "Move in, move in!" to Adrian. He opens the door and the duo barge in.

"End of the line, dickface. Surrender now, or I will do something much worse to you than what you did to this lady." - Vici threatens.

The teacher quickly picks up a giant dirt rag and wraps it around his bottom like a loincloth. At the same time, the girl picks up the teacher's shirt and puts it on like a shitty oversized dress, then stands still, overlooking what's happening in shock and confusion.

"Do you kids know how grounded you are? This room is for lab staff only! We don't take kindly to trespassers in here!"

"The dead can't ground." She throws one of her giant ice balls at the teacher and shatters it, and then splits her other giant ice ball in 2. Adrian starts projecting hardcore porn into the half naked teacher's brain. He blocks the ice shards with his hand. They manage to inflict several bleeding spots on his body, but don't damage his posture a whole lot. The projected porn confuses him for a bit before he regains his composure. As he is blocking the ice shards, he says: "Brump 88, lock the room!", which causes an additional iron door to block the exit from the room. He is then seen dashing at Victoria to grab her with both of his hands. She forms 2 ice shields to deflect the grabs, and while they do shock him with their coldness, he kicks her in the head with his knee, causing Vici to get knocked into a wall, barely keeping balance, and grab a hold of her chin. In the meantime, Adrian puts his sword onto the molester's belly, and Gabriel comes out of his invisibility to kick the teacher into the back of his left knee, causing him to fall on his ass. As he tries to grab Adrian or his sword, Gabriel pulls out a belt from his pocket and begins trying to choke him. While the molester tries to yank the belt from the front to break Gabriel's posture, Victoria steals the ice from Adrian's sword and shield, combines it with the ice balls inside her hands, bends down and creates a tall belt of ice around the teacher's torso. As he tries to roll over to get it off, Vici completes the belt around him, fully trapping him in ice. The teacher stops fighting and begins groaning, while Victoria sits on the ground, grabs her chin and begins heavily breathing. Adrian walks up to the teacher's clothes, finds his phone inside and sees that it's locked. "What's the pin code to your phone, shitface?"

"Please, remove this ice from me, it hurts…"

"We will put more… If you don't… Tell us… " - Vici says with struggle and obvious pain in her voice.

"Fourteen… Eighty Eight…"

"Dude, isn't that an ancient american dogwhistle for nazis?" - Gabriel remembers.

"I guess… It's more of a normal whistle… Considering everyone knows what it means… Holy shit, hurry up, this hurts so much…"

"Okay, there's naked pictures of little girls, fucking gross." - Adrian reports.

"What happened? Why are you guys and the teacher fighting?"

"You were taken advantage of… But you're safe… Hey cuntface, mind opening… The door?"

"Brump 88… Unlock the door… " The door unlocks.

"You've been selling child porn to other staff members in the lab, and some outside the lab too? Our entire lab will bet on whenever you will get a life sentence or a death penalty, this is gonna be awesome. "

"He could also… Just be let go… Because reasons…" - Victoria suggests.

"I am gonna screenshot every incriminating conversation from his phone, send them to myself and post them all publicly, so the adults can't cover this one up. Gabriel, send your parents the video and ask them to edit the video to make it impossible to tell which girl is it and then post the video on LabSocial for every kid to see. Vici, can you walk to the doctor by yourself?"

"I can… Thank you, Adrian…"

Next lesson, back at block 85:

"Kids, we have had brave Adrian, Victoria and Gabriel from a different block excuse themselves from school to catch a pedophile in the act. Several staff members of the lab, including the doctor of our block, were also caught trafficking child porn and are now waiting to be put in jail for most of the rest of their lives. However, what you three did today was completely unprecedented and unethical. Not only you gave Mr. Mollystern severe frostbite, but you also sent some of the evidence directly on LabSocial instead of sending it to your parents or something. You're lucky noone seems to have been able to identify the victims from the screenshots, but you still really shouldn't have done that, Adrian. "

"You guys were gonna cover up the case if we didn't do it and let the guy scott free, so we slapped you in the face with it instead to make sure there was no way out for him. "

The class started clapping. The teacher started thinking for a moment, then sat on his desk, pulled out an empty note and started writing something on it. "Umm… Adrian, you did bad. You know that. " When he was finished, he handed Adrian the note, and continued:

"All 3 culprits have been grounded for a week. I hope you think about what you've done."

At the same time, Adrian read the note. It said, "You did nothing wrong."

Later, Adrian is seen sitting in detention, drawing pictures of himself killing child molesters in different ways, with Vici assisting him in some of them. Eventually he hears behind him:

"Adrian, you've been bailed out again. No idea who had the tokens to do that, considering Victoria was also bailed out along with you now, but you're free to go."

"Awesome."

"And Adrian, can you look me in the face for a second?"

"Yea?"

"I hope you learnt your lesson." His teacher winks.

As Adrian walks out, a massive crowd of random children is standing outside the block, greeting him. Nathan approaches him and tells him:

"Bro. What you three did was absolutely heroic. I thought Victoria was a bully and a sociopath, but she is as much of a hero as the rest of you are. "

"Thanks for busting us out, you all. She's much more than a sociopathic sadist. We will try to arrange the meeting she talked about earlier to happen today, and you will find out even more about her. "

"Can I come into the meeting?" - Gabriel came close to Adrian.

"I have no idea. Did she ever say-"

"Yes, you can come to the meeting. You'd be very welcome there." - Adrian responded.

Fast forward to the actual meeting. It's evening outside. Most of the class is in the rented room with the meeting.

"Thank you all for coming. Unfortunately, Victoria is unable to talk so she can't even video chat herself here, but we still structured the meeting together. Everyone knows how many pedoes we have exposed today. I mean, who could have known so many people would be into stuff like that?" - begins Adrian.

"I had to record Mr. Mollystern doing everything. I wasn't watching, but I could still hear everything. I don't think I will ever see anything more vile in my life. " - Gabriel admitted, sounding like he was about to puke.

"And then there's the one dimensional wars between blocks, where there's no difference between defense and offense. Then there's limited access to knowledge and information online. Then there's a clear lack of theme parks, zooes, museums, trips to factories where they show kids how to make stuff and let them try their hand at making it themselves to bring it home, the lack of everything a normal child needs for healthy development. The only thing we have is wooden swords and eachother's skulls to smash. However, Victoria has a plan on how to fix all of this. When she amasses 20 thousand tokens, she will be free to leave the lab and take anyone who asks with her. " The crowd begins showing moderate excitement. "She is currently at 17 thousand tokens, only around 3 thousand short. And you know how she could get those extra 3K? If our class wins the coin shard game the adults have set for us. So let us fight for our freedoms and destroy anyone who stands in our way!"

The crowd begins thunderously applauding.

S1E16 The Coin Shard Hyperwar

"And so the children who shall receive the coin shards are: Brian of block B0099, Akim from block B0090, and Victoria from block B0085. Congratulations, class, you have a tiny headstart."

"Yay!" - the entire class exclaims.

The teacher gives Victoria a coin shard. The class begins analyzing it with awe. It looks like a map of a circular labyrinth from above, with a star in the middle. "We've been ordered to give all of you 10 minutes to decide how are you going to approach this before allowing you to go outside. Good luck on the game, kids! Remember, nobody is allowed to go inside until 21:00, but you can still ask your parents to sell you stuff like food and equipment and bring it to you near the entrance."

Victoria puts away her coin shard and walks forward to the blackboard. The other kids are discussing something between themselves. "Adrian and Nathan, come here. Let's discuss this. "

"Well, the way I see it, we either attack block 90 or we attack block 99." - Adrian says.

"Block 99 is full of teens. Block 90 kids are still older than us, but we beat them twice before, so I say we attack them. Their leader is no match for our combined might. " - Nathan suggests.

"Guys, this event is a bit less one dimensional than you think. To make our plan of assault, we have to think up what everyone will be trying to do. There are currently 4 sides to this: our block, block 90, block 99 and everyone else. " She draws 3 crosses on the blackboard, one of them in a circle. "The circled cross is our block, and everyone else isn't shown because everyone else will likely do everything that's possible to do. Most likely what's going to happen is that everyone will attack one of the shardbearers. So what we do is camp right near block 90 and wait while the chaos unfolds and everyone beats the shit out of eachother, then we march right in and capitalize on the massacre by taking the shard for ourselves. If we're lucky enough, that way we could get both of the other shards at once, getting us to win in just one day. " As she is explaining this, she draws an arrow from each of the non-circled crosses facing the other non-circled cross, then small arrows surrounding each of the crosses, facing towards the cross. Then she draws an arrow from the circled cross towards the arrows between the other crosses.

"Sounds logical. Seems like we got this in the bag. " - Adrian remarks.

"It is logical. However, this is a lab wide event. At least 95% of the lab would be at eachother's throats until this is all over. Things will go wrong and chaos will probably unfold beyond our imagination, so we have to adapt well to others' moves. "

"We got this!" - all 3 of them say one by one.

"Adrian, would you mind explaining everyone what we're doing?"

"Sure. Attention, everyone. The plan is to camp near the location of the block 90, and when everyone knocks eachother out at the location of the block, we go in and take the coin shard from whoever remains."

"What then?"

"We can't know how step one ends, we'll have to strategize and adapt to the situation. Ideally we go to block 99 and take the shard from whoever is left standing there right afterwards, but there's no chance that case scenario will occur. Also, non-combatants: if you stay near the lab and go about your business, you will probably get assaulted by random warriors and noone will be able to track who did it, so your best bet is to get swords and march with us, pretending to be normal combatants. If we stay together, you will be in less danger. " - Victoria explains.

"How about I rent a room for non combatants to hide instead?" - Kate asks.

"Go ahead, Kate. Well, I think we're ready to go. Let's kick some ass. "

"Kick some ass!" - everyone starts chanting.

Cut to the beginning of the after classes. The block leaves the building, fully equipped for combat, the 3 children with powers in front, and starts running towards block 90. Some of the children have backpacks full of ice maracas. Kate and a few others move towards the rented room to the side in the meantime. Victoria calls Bezdon on the phone. "Morning, Bezdon, what's your status?"

"Morning, Vicci. I guess considering you got a shard, we're awaiting orders from you."

"Go to block 99 and get us the coin shard. We'll handle the other one."

"You got it. Good luck on the hunt!"

"You too."

As they're walking forward, one crowd comes at them from the forward left side, and another from the forward right.

"Here for an ice shard shower, fuckers?" - Victoria asks.

"We're all here to join you!" - someone from the crowd on the left says.

"Don't speak for us, we're here to fuck you all up before you properly get to anyone!" - someone from the crowd on the right says. The crowds start arguing with eachother.

"Everyone on the left, attack the crowd to the right so they don't impede our movement. If anyone remains standing, feel free to join us." - Adrian shouts to get through everyone being loud. The crowds attack eachother, while block 85 group runs around them. Eventually, they arrive near what looks like a huge battle and take positions in an empty block nearby.

"That's them, alright. Can someone come closer and dm me the intel on what's going on there once in a while?"

A few boys raised their hand, but \*boy 2\* ran ahead and said:

"I'll go. For victory and Victoria!"

"Godspeed, dude!" - Adrian waved him.

"Now we camp here and find the shard from the ashes."

After a while of sitting in their phones, the group hears:

"Looking for this, kiddos?" Akim arrives from the side, with most of his class behind him.

"Okay, how did he know what we were doing?" - Adrian asked. Nathan begins charging up a fireball.

"It's simple. You should have had more pest control. We all knew your plan right after you left, and it was all for the price of 50 tokens. Ain't that a bitch?"

"You actually just made our jobs a hell of a lot easier." Victoria throws an ice maraca grenade at Akim, but he zaps it midair with his lightning, shattering it instantly. The tiny amount of shards that landed dealt minimum damage to anyone.

"You're gonna need to try harder than that!"

He creates a lot of stormy clouds that start zapping the ground beneath them, and then casting lightning orbs near him in a line that launch onto the enemies after a delay. Adrian starts projecting porn onto Akim's brain, but it has no effect. Victoria blocks the lightning orbs aimed at her, but gets a mild electric shock because her ice shield she formed on the spot conducted electricity. Nathan launches the giant fireball at him through the stormy clouds. Akim tries to zap it midair aswell, misses, then decides to dodge it at the last second. The fragments of the fireball hit him a little, but he keeps standing. After Victoria recovers from the shock, she starts dashing at Akim through the hazards. When he sees it, he plants a few bright lightningy circles with weird symbols on the ground. As a result, she steps back to analyze the situation.

"These are the Electro Mines. Step on one, and you'll get thoroughly electrocuted! Come on, try and reach me!"

Victoria takes off her dress and throws it to Adrian. She then launches 2 shattering ice maracas downwards in arcs that get all the Electro Mines detonated remotely and starts charging at Akim again.

"Nooo, that's not fair!" He summons more delayed lightning orbs, which Vici manages to safely block by forming an ice shield and launching it at the lightning balls while shattering the shield into large fragments. Akim tries to put a mine on her way, but she reacts and jumps over it. When she gets close, she launches 2 shattering ice maracas at Akim. He tries to attack her at the same time with his lightning, but the lightning hits the ice shards and his attack does nothing. After the ice shards stun Akim for a long several seconds, Victoria finally reaches the point blank distance to Akim and forms an ice collar around his neck, causing him to fall on the ground. His block is way too afraid to do anything against her.

"Your powers would have worked well. In a tower defense game, anyway. The shard, if you please."

Akim pulls it out of his pocket and hands it out to Vici without a word.

"Enjoy watching me annihilate this game from your back seat." She turns his ice collar back into an ice maraca.

"You're strong, miss. But there's someone even stronger out there. You can't win this. "

"Me and Bezdon are working together. I am pretty sure we can." She turns around and goes back to her group.

Akim stands up and whispers. "Yea, she's up for a rude awakening."

The block 85 group begins cheering and celebrating.

"Let's go, Vici!" - exclaims Adrian, raising his ice sword into the air.

"He really wasn't so tough after all!" - Nathan notes. "

"Are we heading to block 99?"

"Yes, we are. Can you put away my dress in one of my backpacks? "

As Adrian and some other guys with backpacks do that, Adrian asks: "Why do you not always wear your actual combat clothes? I can imagine it's a lot comfier without the dress. "

Mid conversation, as they're done putting away Victoria's dress, they continue marching onward. "It's about style, Adrian. Besides, if I defeat someone in the dress, I am subtly telling them how superior I am to them. This battle, however, will decide the fate of the entire lab. We need to give it our all and more. "

"Yes, we do."

Victoria gives Bezdon another call. "Bezdon, we have 2 out of 3 shards. What's your status?"

"Holy shit, is that you? The sun has crashed into the earth and the solar soldiers are invading! They're destroying everything! We need backup! We need all the backup we have!"

Victoria looks up. The sun still seems to be in the sky.

"What's the last thing you remember before any of that happened?"

"I was going through a colorful, beautiful forest and marching with the boys to kill the great green bear of Helsinki. But the sun has burnt down the forest and killed the bear, probably! We need backup, now!"

"Goodbye, Bezdon."

"Wait, no-" She hangs up on him.

"He's fucking high. We're on our own. "

"How could he get high, though? I don't think alcohol can do that to a man, neither can cigarettes… Unless… Oh holy shit, are these guys high too?"

Ahead of them they see a lot of people ahead, including a seemingly endless horde of children on drugs doing intoxicated things.

"Great. Rainbow gas epidemic part two. " - Adrian remarks. The block stops at one block away from the high horde.

"I don't think we have a lot of gas masks. We haven't prepared for the rainbow gas guy to start wreaking havoc again. We need to decide what do we do now, and fast."

"Alert, there's a block of troopers marching straight at us from the right!" - someone yells from the group.

"En garde!" - Nathan commands.

Everyone gets in defensive positions, while the 3 kids with powers move to the right to face the block marching on them. In front of the opposing group stands a girl in black and purple clothes, cape and decorative white skulls on her shoulders, aswell as a beautiful metallic circlet with several purple looking rocks in the middle. Nathan begins charging up a fireball.

"Looking to fulfill your frostbite fetish?" - Victoria begins.

"Oh, Victoria, that's you, right? I am so happy to meet you face to face!"

"What the fuck's going on?" - Adrian asks out loud. Victoria looks confused too.

"I am happy to meet you too, Adrian! Please, please don't project cursed images into my mind. I promise you, you won't regret it. "

"Why wouldn't I regret it?"

"So we could all hang out after this is all over! Come on, you guys are legends."

"Oh, you think you're being clever or something? I can see straight through what you're doing. Don't even try it. " - Vici begins.

"What are you talking about?"

"You're applying rizz to us in order to betray us later so you can acquire our coin shards without a proper fight. It's not gonna work. Face me, or go home and sit out the event. "

"Oh no no no, you got me all wrong. I \*am\* here to take the coin shards from you. I just think you're badasses and I don't want you to hate me for what I am about to do. "

"Who the fuck does she think she is, talking like that when facing the lab's most notoriously strong block?" - Asks Adrian.

"I am Monica. And I have never known defeat. Mainly because I have never actually been in a fight with fellow warriors with powers. How about we get on with it?" She summons 2 black flame mages to her left and the right, then 2 more black flame swordsmen in the front, then puts her hands behind her back.

"Adrian, she's far too much of an unknown quantity to ruin her childhood with your magic just yet. You're gonna have to sit this one out." - Victoria says.

"Thank you!" - Monica approves.

"If you're trying to make me feel bad about destroying you, you have better chances of heisting the corpse of Lenin, Monica. Nathan, let's give Monica a cold welcome. "

As they approach their adversary, Monica summons 6 more black flame swordsmen and makes them charge at the duo, and also makes the mages fire black flame fireballs. Nathan throws the huge fireball he casted onto the approaching 6 swordsmen, leaving only traces of black gas where they used to be, while Victoria blocks incoming fireballs with her ice shields. She sprints up to the left side, while Nathan sprints up to the right side. Victoria turns her shields into ice balls and converts them into a hailstorm of ice shards, flying at the 2 mages to the left and 2 swordsmen at the center, both of which nearly dissipate, but still remain. They all instantly counterattack Victoria, while Monica launches a giant black flame comet at her with her right hand. She manages to block all of it with a two handed ice shield, other than the comet, which goes straight through the shield and burns her shoulder. In the meantime, as Nathan was sprinting to the right, evading the black fireballs, he put his hands into his mouth, inhaled, and exhaled by breathing fire. He did, however, completely miss.

Monica spawned an extra swordsman behind Victoria's back and an extra two near Nathan. Nathan pulled out his sword and attempted to fight all 4 ghosts targeting him by putting his left hand into his mouth and attacking one of the swordsmen. He then exhaled with fire breath at the swordsmen, destroying them instantly, but got hit in turn by 2 black fireballs and fell on his back, nearly not losing his balance. In the meantime, Victoria blocked the swordsman behind her with an extra ice shield, went back a little, and converted her shields into ice balls to shatter them onto the ghosts attacking her again. She then pulled out one extra ice maracas and threw it at the remaining ghost, destroying him instantly. She dashed at Monica, pulled out 2 more ice maracas and prepared to shatter them into her face, but Monica suddenly pulled out a giant black flame greatsword from behind her back with her right hand and swung it with her full force at the bottom side of Victoria's torso, flinging her a massive distance towards Nathan. Vici grabbed the part of her body that took the hit.

"Agh… What the hell…"

Monica ceased fire. Nathan got up and began staring at what happened in awe.

"You okay there? I trained my swinging force for a very long time. I've never seen anyone take it and remain standing. " - Monica asked.

"No… That ace up your sleeve saved you something fierce… Nathan, stall her, don't let her take my tokens…"

Nathan did literally nothing. "Don't worry, I am not after your tokens. Hand over the coin shards and I'll leave you to go home and rest."

"Fine… But this isn't over… Not by a long shot… " She picks up the coin shards with her right hand and gives them to Monica.

"I know it probably isn't. Still, please don't get angry at me for doing this. I am willingly not taking your money, I hope you remember that next time we meet."

"I don't feel anger... I only feel sadness and dread… That said… Nevermind."

"It's been a pleasure to meet you. See you around!" Monica turns around and leaves with her class.

Adrian and the rest of the class walk up to Victoria and Adrian squats near her. "Can you walk? I've never seen anyone get flung like a baseball like that. "

"Tell me about it."

Cut to the duo sitting on their usual bench looking sad, while the rest of the class is going about their daily lives like there's nothing going on. It's early evening outside.

"How did we lose this fast? We barely even started and the next thing we know, there's a new champion of the lab who kicks asses left and right who took our only chances of victory." - Adrian complained.

"Even if we lost, there's still a chance we can make the rest of the cash without winning. The kissing business is a giant cash cow, plus we can do mercenary work here and there. Should only take us a couple months until we have enough. "

"A couple months… That's so much fucking time."

"I am more frustrated from losing to someone whose powers awoke 3 days ago. I am clearly not doing enough to improve my strength."

"Same as me. In any fight where projecting porn into their heads isn't an option, I am completely useless."

Vici reads something on her phone. "Look at this. Apparently many tried to breach the hordes of rainbow gas zombies around block 99, but none succeeded. Even Monica only got so far before giving up and retreating to her home block. "

"So we didn't lose."

"Brian can keep everyone around him high on rainbow gas indefinitely, so our best bet is to wait until tomorrow and kick his ass before anyone else reaches him."

"I think Bezdon lives closer to Brian. He could try again, with a gas mask this time, while we locate Monica and get our revenge."

"She won't know what hit her. I've got a little surprise for her aswell."

"Do you know why Kate isn't challenging us and just going along with what we're doing?"

"Your guess is as good as mine. I mean, it's clear that we have undisputed authority over the class so challenging us would be suicide. She could be going along with what we're doing because she believes in our cause, because she wants the best for our block or because that's the most rational thing she can do. "

"Really hope it's the first. I miss her."

"Not a lot we can do except keep going and hope for the best."

The next day, it's almost 8 in the morning. The 3 kids in charge stand near the door, looking at the entire class.

"Yesterday didn't go that well, but thankfully it's not too late for us to win. When we're forced outside at 8, we attack Monica again. I am much better prepared this time and I am confident we will win."

As she says this, she writes a dm to Bezdon: "Morning. A new day has started, but the plan hasn't. Buy a gas mask and retrieve the coin shard from Brian. We'll blast Monica to the ground, regroup and win the game."

At the same time, Brian is seen talking to another teen. He hands him a whole stack of 3d printed copies of his coin shard.

"Grisha, I have a task for you. Go around the lab and drop these fake coin shards everywhere without being seen. It's the only way for us to be able to keep the real one for long enough to find a buyer and sell it to them for a thousand tokens. "

"Why can't we take the other shards ourselves?"

"These two main girls are monstrously strong. And besides, my powers are easily countered with a mere gas mask. We can't win, but we don't necessarily have to lose. "

Cut to the block 85 leaving their building, Nathan, Vici and Adrian in front. Victoria is without her dress from the start this time. Kate and a few others go to the rented room, again. Suddenly, Victoria abruptly stops and asks:

"Wait. Where does Monica even live?"

Nathan and Adrian shrug.

"Fuck. Hold on, I'll look it up."

Cut to Lumina crouching on top of a block building a few blocks from block 85, lightsaber in hand. She sees that the main group is standing still and not doing anything, and lunges at the block leaders from the right, her lightsaber aimed at Adrian.

Adrian notices her energy readings and yells "Lumina!". He steps forward to dodge the lunge while Victoria and Nathan step back a bunch. Lumina misses the initial thrust, but manages to use the momentum from the lunge to roll forward. She tries to slash Victoria's legs, but gets blasted with a load of ice shards in her face mid attack. It causes her to almost lose her balance, but she manages to stand up. Everyone, including the normal soldiers, moves further away from her.

"Great, if it isn't Obitch-Slut Clitnobi. Did you miss the feeling of being trapped in ice for hours?" - Victoria opened with audible dread in her voice. The block leaders circle around her to move closer together. Nathan begins charging a big fireball.

"Say whatever you want. You don't have much time left anyway. None of you do."

"Don't you have anything better to do?" - asks Nathan. In response, Lumina fires an eye laser at Nathan's balls, making him fall on the ground from pain, roll up into a ball and groan from pain.

"Oh my god, she blasted Nathan's balls!" - Adrian exclaims.

"You monster!" - someone from the ground yells at her.

"You know you can't win this. Even without Nathan, we will annihilate you." - Victoria comments.

"Why do we keep doing this?" - Asks Adrian with exasperation in his voice. Suddenly, Jason levitates from somewhere into the view, his arms stretched out to the side and his knees still bent over, and lands near Lumina. He is still dressed in sinister black and red clothes. Everyone around looks shocked, except Lumina and Victoria.

"Hey there." - he opens.

"Jason, this is Adrian, who forged a conspiracy to put you behind bars."

"Dude. I am pretty sure I learned what's manipulation that day for the first time. Do you really think I would have had enough wits to frame you up like that?"

"Don't trust a single word he says. He's a liar and a master manipulator." - Lumina tells Jason.

"I was actually wondering how would it feel fighting you, Jason. It's obvious that you will always trust your best friend over some guys you don't even know, so how about we jump right into it?"

"You're absolutely right, and yes, I agree." - Jason replies. Jason lifts up Victoria into the air, preventing her from attacking, while Adrian starts projecting porn into Lumina's brain.

"No… What the fuck is this… What's wrong with you… "

This continues for a few moments, until Victoria says: "We could be doing this all day. Jason, how about you and Adrian try to overpower eachother while I give Miss Take a nice shower of ice shards?"

"I hate to say this, but she's right! Do it!" - Lumina remarks with audible emotional pain.

Meanwhile, Bezdon arrives to block 99 with a gas mask. The whole area is still surrounded with rainbow gas, but unlike yesterday, there's no gas drunk kids, only Brian and his class chilling out.

"Sup, Brian. I am here to take the shard." Bezdon has his void tentacles facing Brian in anticipation of combat.

"Hey man, it's okay, I don't want no trouble. Send me a thousand tokens and it's all yours."

"Dude, you are in no position to ransom the shard for this much money. You can give it to me now, or I will give you a Bezdon special."

"500 tokens?"

"250 and it's a deal."

"Okay, okay! Just get this stupid thing off of me."

Bezdon transfers Brian the tokens, and Brian hands him over the coin shard. "Pleasure doing business with you."

"Likewise."

As Bezdon walks away, Brian turns around and pulls out 3 more coin shards from his pockets. "Foolish child. Should have taken the thousand deal. I am going to have the time of my life with these tokens."

Back to the main group. Jason drops Victoria from the air and lifts up Adrian instead. Vici lands on her feet with no issues, and Adrian starts telepathically projecting porn onto Jason instead. He gets confused by the intrusion into his mind, but then says:

"Whoa, this is awesome! Adrian, what are you even trying to do?"

"I am projecting porn into your head. Children are generally not ready to witness those images, which incapacitates them with ease. Are you saying you're immune too?"

Jason levitates Adrian closer to himself. "Dude, I love this, it's so freaky! You got any more?"

"Aren't we meant to be fighting or something?"

Jason gently puts Adrian down. "Fuck the battle. You have something amazing in your mind and I wanna know and see more!"

"Works for me." Adrian sits next to Jason and they begin talking about something.

In the meantime, Victoria stands a medium distance away from Lumina and blocks one of her eye lasers with her ice shield. Lumi then jumps into the air and prepares to dive slash Vici with her lightsaber, but Victoria converts her ice shield and the ice maraca in her other hand into a hollow icicle and launches it at Lumina, landing in her right shoulder and causing her to stagger for a good while and put her left hand on where the icicle landed. Seeing that the attack landed, Vici prepares and throws another icicle at Lumina, but this time she dodges it by flying to the right a little, then starts the diving slash attack anyway. Vici deflects it with an ice shield formed from 2 ice maracas, but also falls on her ass from the force of the dive. Lumina, horizontally floating in the air, gets staggered by the deflect and shoots an eye laser into Victoria's left knee after recovering, but Vici blocks it with the same shield, converts it into an ice ball and throws it back at her, shattering it midair. The attack did minor damage, but gave Victoria a window to do something, so she bolted onto her legs and grabbed Lumina's neck with her freezing hand, which was just close to the ground. The pain from the grab deactivated Lumina's wings and made her fall down on the ground near her facedown, which Vici noticed and put away her hand so she didn't get dragged with her opponent. Vici pulled out 2 more ice maracas out of her pockets in anticipation of Lumina's next move, but all that happened is Lumina groaned some and didn't do anything.

"It's always same shit, different day with you. I suppose I should leave you a parting gift as a reminder." She put an ice ball inside Lumina's shirt and turned it into a sheet of ice. Lumina started shrieking. "You're too weak to know when to quit it. You can't help but to keep pushing when there's nothing for you to gain. Hopefully beating your head against a wall will one day smash your head into pieces. Until next time."

She turns around and sees Adrian and Jason sitting on the ground and talking, with Jason laughing and Adrian visibly having fun. Nathan is nowhere to be found as he is visiting the doctor.

"Wow, how did this happen?"

"I've got a better question, why don't you publish your literature? You've written the funniest and the most amazing story I've ever seen in my life. It's just so good!" - Jason responds.

"God damn it, Adrian, that one was meant to be a spell to be used in combat."

"Oh, sorry."

"You better hope he doesn't randomly decide tomorrow that we're actually horrible human beings and go back to Lumina so they can start bothering us together forever more."

"Not happening. He told me about the way I've been put in jail. She framed me up aswell as her girl friends so she could take over the block."

"That sounds very in character for her."

"I had no idea she started sucking so much now. She used to be great, even if trigger-happy. Is she okay, by the way?"

"She fell onto the ground face down and got a sheet of ice under her shirt. One of those was my fault. "

Some of the classmates of Victoria sprint to the trio with phones in their hands. "Guys, holy shit, we have news! Check this out!"

Cut to Monica and her block walking towards block 99 so they could retrieve the last shard needed to win the game. Suddenly, someone from the group says:

"Moni, there's a shard lying right on the ground over there!"

"What? Why would there be-" She notices the shard, approaches it, picks it up. She then pulls out her other coin shards and combines all 3 and sees that they form a complete coin. Everyone begins cheering.

"I have no idea what just happened, but I am pretty sure we just won the game!" - she said with genuine joy.

Monica is then seen approaching her teacher and handing her over the three coin shards.

"We got all the coin shards, teacher! It was easy but it was also so much fun."

The teacher pulls out his phone and sees that the 2 shards are located where the teacher is, while the third one is still at block 99.

"Monica, what have I told you about cheating in life?"

"You either don't get caught, or you don't cheat. Why? Did I miss something?"

"One of the shards you surrendered is fake. It looks similar to others, but the tracker shows that one of the shards is still in possession of Brian from block 99."

"What? But we found the last shard on the ground somewhere!" - she said with sadness.

"I am sorry, but you've been caught cheating. I am gonna have to confiscate both of these shards and discuss with my superiors what are we going to do with you and the game in general."

"Damn it, that's so unfair!"

When she leaves for outside, she's greeted with cheers.

"Did we win the game? Are there any other secret challenges?"

"One of the shards we found was a fake and Brian has had the real third shard in his possession the entire time. She told me she'll decide what to do with me and the game. "

Everyone becomes visibly and audibly appalled.

"Bullshit!"

"God damn it!"

"I know what I have to do, assuming we aren't disqualified. Everyone, stay here." - Monica said with confidence and sadness.

"You still did amazing!"

"There's still a chance! You've got this!"

"You're the best, Monica!"

Back to block 85 where most of the group is standing together.

"Forged coin shards? Dude. I mean, it's obvious at this point that Brian did it somehow, but… Oh no, I just remembered something." - Vici says.

"What?" - Jason asks.

Victoria calls Bezdon on her phone and activates a loudspeaker. "Bezdon, we have a development. Apparently Brian has somehow been distributing fake coin shards, which caused Monica to pick one up and try to surrender it with 2 of the real ones, so she got caught for what the adults perceived as cheating and all her coin shards were taken away. What's your status?"

"He wanted to sell me the coin shard, or I guess a coin shard for a thousand tokens. "

"I could have covered that. Sounds reasonable."

"He seemed desperate to take it off, so when I said 250 tokens, he agreed and sold one to me."

"Oh my god, Bezdon, nobody would ever agree to cut the price by 75% just because the buyer asked them to. If I was in his place, I would have sold you a fake as the real one for trying that, which he almost certainly did."

"Oh, that fucking asshole! I am going to have a friendly chat with him over this. Any other news?"

"No, we're done for the day. I mean, you're free to try to bully the real shard from him at the same time with your money. According to LabSocial, he still has it. "

"Alright. Peace out."

Cut to Monica in a gas mask traversing the rainbow gas to reach block 99. Brian notices her from afar and tells her:

"Welcome in! Do I know you?"

"You sure know how to cheat and remove fun from this game, that's for sure."

"Hey, I can't stand up to you, you anime fucking kids who can stand on their arms and, I don't know, climb walls without any equipment. I am just a simple teen from an earlier generation, my powers aren't that strong. I just want to be able to get some money off of this game instead of being completely annihilated by whoever gets through the rainbow gas first. "

Monica summons 4 black flame swordsmen in front of her and 4 black flame mages on each side mid sentence. "While I understand your desires, your plot of fake coin shards was a grievous mistake on your part. But I am here for all the coin shards you have on you, both real and fake. Give them to me or face me."

"250 tokens and they're all yours."

"There's 12 black flame ghosts in front of you, ready to swarm and overwhelm you. I am not paying you 250 tokens for something I can take from you by force in 5 minutes. Best you're getting is 15."

"Hey guys, a little girl is trying to extort our shards!" 6 other teens of different genders arrive to stand to the side of Brian.

She starts covertly casting a spell by smoothly waving her hands. A giant black circle with a 4 sided star inside appears underneath Brian and the 3 teens standing to the right of him. One of them becomes alarmed by the sight but doesn't do anything. "Alright, alright, yeesh. Let's talk about this. I agree to pay you guys 40 tokens for every single shard you have. How does that sound?"

"40 tokens? Come on. You're breaking my balls over here. "

"Now, now, let's talk this through. How about…" A black flame explosion occurs at where the circle was positioned. Everyone in the explosion radius got launched to the side and lit on black fire, making them roll around on the ground and screaming in pain, the 2 closer to the epicenter more than others. The unaffected teens got majorly startled and shocked. "I can cheat too, guys."

"Dude, we were just following orders! Don't nuke us too, please!" - The unaffected teens say and run away. Monica and her black flame elementals approach the burning teens, and she absorbs the black flames from everyone except Brian at range.

"Go back to what you were doing before, guys. I don't mean any harm to you." The extinguished teens run away.

"Help! It hurts so much!"

After a delay, she extinguishes Brian aswell.

"Why couldn't you just hand them over right away? 25 tokens for screwing my entire block over and doing absolutely nothing else was a good price."

"Oh my god, I am so sorry! 25 tokens! I agree! Deal!"

"It's too late for that. Just give me the shards and I won't hurt you anymore."

"Okay, okay!"

He pulls out 6 coin shards out of one of his pockets and 1 more from another and puts them on the ground. "The single one is the real one!"

"See, it wasn't so hard, wasn't it?" As she picks up the shards and shoves them in her pockets, Bezdon arrives from the left of where Monica arrived from.

"Hey, Bezdon! I'd recognize those void tendrils from anywhere. Why are you here?"

"Monica? This dickhead scammed me for 250 tokens, I am here to get them back, plus the shard."

"Oh you can have the money, but the shard is mine, unless you're ready to throw down."

"Hey, when I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to fight a girl who soloed Victoria and Nathan all by herself. You can have the shard for now."

"In that case, have a good rest of your day! Feels great to be in the same league as you." She turns around, consumes her black flame elementals and leaves.

Bezdon approaches Brian. "Show me your token balance."

"No, it's okay, I'll transfer you the 250 I took from you. I've had enough of her bullshit."

"Nope, you're giving me all you got."

Brian starts transferring Bezdon the money. "No problem. You're smart not to have fought her. She doesn't look threatening, but I wouldn't be surprised if she could summon Satan from the depths of hell and sell all of our souls to him."

"Me neither."

Next morning, Adrian leaves his apartment. Vici is standing right near the entrance.

"Oh, morning."

"Hi. You slept in today, didn't you?"

"I suppose I did. "

"Well, we got news. Monica presented the adults with 1 fake and 2 real coin shards and argued for why she shouldn't have had her coin shards taken away. She would have won there and then, but the adults are fucking stupid and they have decided that it was all her idea, so they gave her real coin shards to Lumina and Gary."

"Let me guess. Someone dropped an anonymous tip that they've seen Monica's blockmate drop fake coin shards all around the lab."

Victoria giggles. "Oh you mischievous little demon, Vicci."

"It was a bit more complicated than that, but yes, it happened under my command."

"So, I know we're gonna capitalize the fuck out of this situation. What's the plan, exactly?"

"The two of us will go fight Gary. I fought him before, I know his weaknesses. He is monstrously tough and he hits very hard, but raw strength alone won't save him from getting destroyed once more. In the meantime, Bezdon will face Lumina. He is critically weak to her powers, but Jason will help counter her. He's been explained the full context of what's happening and he is on our side."

"Yes, we'll get to kick some asses together!" He hugs Vici.

"Oh yes, we will. I've decided to let everyone else do whatever they want until we specifically need help. It's all in our hands now."

Cut to the duo approaching Gary's block.

"I wonder how well he's gonna take your new icicles."

"Probably very well. I get the feeling the grenades would work much better. "

The 8 year olds at Gary's block are seen practicing, Gary included. When they see Adrian and Victoria approach, they face the soon to be attackers and get into combat positions.

"Well, well, well. Seems like you've been given a chance for a rematch, Gary." - opens Vici.

"You can't defeat us, grandma! We will stand and fight to the last soldier!" - some confident looking kid in the block declares.

"We have our money and our pride to protect. We could also sell you the coin shard for 250 tokens."

"While I would normally accept it if you lowered the price a little, we're in the mood for a fight. No deal."

"Have you ever heard of the tragedy of a funny little kid who can ruin a childhood in 10 seconds? Not a tragedy that happened to him, mind you, but instead a tragedy that he brings upon anyone he is determined to defeat. "

"Why won't you stop talking and get right to it?" - the same confident kid asks. The duo charges forward in response. Victoria throws 2 ice maracas grenades at the crowd of her enemies, getting a decent chunk to run away, while Adrian sprints by Gary and starts attacking normal kids with his ice sword, who easily succumb to the blunt force and the temperature of the sword, while at the same time paying attention to where Gary is. When he walks close to Adrian and tries to smash him, Adrian disengages and dashes away from the attack reach of his enemies. By this point Victoria has incapacitated and scared out of combat the entire block minus like 5 troopers with shattering ice maracas from the left side due to not having to worry about being attacked by Gary. Gary runs up to Adrian and launches a horizontal strike onto him, which Adrian deflects despite getting staggered by the force of the swing. At the same time, the standard 8 year olds swing at Adrian but manage to deal marginal damage before getting blasted by shattering ice maracas from the back. As Gary was distracted by the defeat of his comrades, Victoria shoved a sheet of ice behind his pants and moved aside to not get crushed by Gary falling on his back, while Adrian attacked Gary's right hand with his full force.

"Stop! This hurts too much! I surrender the shard!"

Victoria retracts the ice from behind Gary back onto her hands. Adrian also stops and steps back. Gary puts his hand in his pocket and gives Adrian the shard.

"I admire your strength, Victoria. You're a legendary warrior." He turns towards her.

"The secret is to realize that ends justify the means, while also carefully weighing the costs and benefits of every morally questionable action you take to achieve your goals. Farewell."

The duo walk away.

"Well that was easy." - said Adrian.

"Yea, you did an amazing job drawing their aggro."

"Hanging with you will never get old."

"One day I'll understand why that's the way you feel about me. "

Cut to block 83. Jason and Lumina are arguing heatedly, as the entire rest of the block watches. Lumina has a bandage around her chin.

"Why? I simply don't understand. Why would you repeatedly try to rematch against an opponent who very clearly outmatches you, even if it puts you and your friends at risk of torture? If your mom slapped you, would you still try to fight back until you can't?"

"It's called determination. You wouldn't understand. "

"It's called recklessness. And why wouldn't you want to go ahead with Victoria's plan to free anyone who wants to be freed?"

"Because I wouldn't be able to kick her ass if she leaves! And because without the block's best we will rot out of boredom and there will be no anime fights here anymore."

"So why not move out where the anime fights happen? Anyone who will stay here will rot out of boredom regardless of what happens. We vowed together to protect everyone's fun and fight the bad guys, and the only way we can do that is by going along with Victoria!"

"You just won't understand."

Bezdon arrives at the block, tentacles ready to attack.

"Let me guess. You're betraying me and you'll try to take the shard from me now?"

Jason lifts up Lumina into the air. She tries to use her wings to break free but it doesn't do much right now. "You betrayed me first. You're not the same person I knew before the big house."

"You're stupid if you think we shouldn't be able to get out of here." - Bezdon comments.

Suddenly, Akim comes out from the crowd and zaps Jason with his lightning. He loses control over Lumina's body, who manages to stay in the air after that for a moment before Bezdon slaps her away, causing her to fall on the ground near Akim. Both Jason and Lumina stand up.

"Ready for some shock therapy?" - Akim remarks.

"Ready to suffocate you in my void tentacles, that's for sure." - Bezdon replies.

As they prepare for combat, a lot of soldiers with water guns and sprays suddenly attack everyone. As the regular kids block 83 get sprayed, they start running around in terror and disgust, some start puking, a lot run away. Some try to approach Bezdon and Jason, but he manages to knock everyone back with the void tendrils. Akim and Lumina get sprayed from behind, causing Akim to puke and Lumina to run around screaming. Lumina gets overwhelmed by the invading kids and sprayed some more.

"What do you think you're doing? Do you want to get a void tendril whiplash?"

Someone throws what appears to be a water balloon at Bezdon aswell filled with some brown particles. "Oh, holy shit, ew, disgusting!" He runs away, while Jason lifts himself up into the air and flies away. The invading kids manage to loot Lumina who is too disgusted to do anything and take her coin shard for themselves.

Back to Victoria and Adrian.

"Interesting. Looks like while we were gone, a random block no one cares about ambushed Monica and took her shard armed with water guns filled with a mixture of… piss and shit? The block 83 battlefield got hit aswell." - she read from her phone.

"It's almost like ethical warfare doesn't matter to people anymore."

"These idiots are a vast minority. The amount of heat they caused ever since the day began will put them on everyone's radar and they will be annihilated just like Gary's class. "

"Dude, is that them ahead of us?"

Adrian and Victoria see an army in the distance, coming straight at the duo.

"If we fight them, they'll cover us in shiss. If we don't, Monica's allies are bound to get them first and get the shards."

"Well, you said it yourself that ends justify the means." Adrian pulls out a gas mask.

"I don't have a gas mask and they will get destroyed faster if I was the one with it. Give it to me. "

Adrian complies. "Fuck them up."

Victoria walks closer to the kids with shiss guns and throws a couple of shattering ice maracas at them, while Adrian stood a good distance away and projected porn onto the enemy group. A few splashes of the gross mixture reached Victoria, but she didn't react. Shortly after, a black flame explosion detonates, and the black flame elementals finish off the rest of the group. Monica appears from behind the group. Her clothes are dirty and wet.

"How did you get here? Didn't these guys bully the shard out of you?"

"Hey. They did, but I couldn't let it distract myself from losing the game. I knew you two were next, so I followed them until they ran into you."

"I attacked them first. Their shards are mine."

"Not happening. You aren't winning this game without defeating me."

"I don't wanna fight you right now. My clothes are covered in shit and piss. "

"I can say the same about myself. Wanna search them for the shards and split them between eachother, shower and swap our clothes, and only then fight?"

Vici thinks for a second. "I guess this is our best bet."

"The dude with the red shirt has the shards…" - some downed kid says.

"There's several dudes with red shirts."

"You need the one with the lighter red one…"

Conveniently, that one was lying near Monica. She loots his pockets, and finds the 2 shards inside, then throws one to Victoria.

"I appreciate your honesty in this moment, but I am watching you. "

"You like what you see?" Monica smiles.

"I personally don't see what kind of ulterior motives could be behind you. So yes, I like what I see." - Adrian answers instead.

"Thank you! I am seriously not as multi-layered as you think. Regardless, I really hate being in this soggy and smelly outfit. I'll see you at my block. I hope you'll learn to trust me someday." She goes away to the side somewhere.

Victoria puts away her ice maracas and shows Monica goodbye a hand of goodbye.

"Maybe you're right about her."

"I mean, she could have taken the coin shards for herself and then taken both of us down. "

They walk around the knocked out kids and go to their block building. "Attempting that would have been suicide. She knows how potent your powers are, and giving you a reason to use it on her would have resulted in her getting instantly incapacitated and losing the game. "

"Good point."

"I have an idea. I'd like you to go to her block and to just talk to her when she's finished getting ready. I will need some extra time anyway. Maybe you can manage to extract a red flag from her."

"Works for me." Adrian gives his coin shard to Victoria.

"Not right now. We need to get to our block first in case someone smart decides to ambush me."

"I'll never say no to spending more time with you."

"Would you stop it already?"

"Oh, sorry, okay."

"No, when I say stop it about saying things like that, it means… It means the exact opposite. I don't know how to explain."

Cut to Adrian approaching Monica's block. Her class is initially just chilling, but when they see him approach some stand up and draw their swords. Vasiliy is also there, but he doesn't react to Adrian at all.

"I have no shards on me. Attacking me would just result in free bruises and traumas."

Everyone sheathes their swords. "What are you doing here? The fight won't start for a

while."

"Just wanna talk to Monica before the fight."

"That's fine, but we're watching you."

"If you ever meet a hungry cougar who is ready to jump on your neck and break it in half, and I mean the animal, would you talk to it like that too? I might not be able to break your necks in half, but I can break your childhoods in half. "

"Jesus, why would you say that? Look, we're not here to stop you if you're not planning on attacking anyone. Just don't hurt us, please."

"That's better." Adrian sits near the entrance to the block building and goes into his phone to drag time. "Sweet. Love having powers of trauma."

Eventually, Monica exits the building, same clothes as previously but clean this time. "Oh, hello there! Looking for me?"

Adrian stands up and puts away the phone. "I am, actually. Just wanted to talk, not necessarily about anything in particular."

"I'd love to! Come on, there's a bench near a wall somewhere here."

"It's funny, me and Vici sit on a bench away from everyone and just chill together until a crisis of sorts happens or she gets an idea to do something crazy."

"That sounds lovely! You two seem to have a very sweet bond. "

"Oh, we do. I am glad you see her as something more than a heartless sociopathic one woman army who only cares about money."

"Are you two in a relationship?"

"I wish. I should try to get into it with her again, thanks for reminding me. "

"Good luck! I wouldn't honestly have had a problem with her if that's all there was to her. Her powers are always so majestic and joyous to watch. Do you know why is she so distrustful of me? What have I done to warrant that sentiment?"

"You see, she is a very complicated person with a deep personality. Her entire character has been formed through struggles in life and desensitization to violence. She doesn't just not trust you, she doesn't trust anyone other than me, actually, due to said past experiences, especially figures of authority. She always assumes the worst intentions from people who she sees as such. I suppose in her mind, you are a figure of authority of sort."

"Not by choice. I was always content with being a regular Rachel with a wooden sword and a radiator of emotional support for my classmates, and the next thing I know, I have to take sides in this conflict and decide the fate of the entire lab."

"I gotta say, you also have unique moves. Never seen anyone summon minions like you're some sort of summoner class in an action RPG."

"I am glad you like it! I love the contrast between sinister powers and my personality of a kind hearted fangirl."

"I don't really know what kind of personality I have. Can't say I've always been using my powers for the force of good."

"With great power comes great responsibility, however, we've children. We don't always know what's best. My classmates were really angry at you two for you destroying our kissing business. It was definitely wrong, but also, our entire culture within this lab is built around bullying and might making right. "

"Oh no, was it your block? Holy shit, that's awkward…" He covers his face with hands.

"It was definitely wrong, but at least now we all know why does she hoard tokens, and honestly, there are worse causes to be fighting for."

"Why are you against us in this, anyway? You don't even sound that content with living in the lab. "

"I am, actually. Sure, we have problems, but I have a tightly knit class I am happy to support in times of need, and we have the occasional battle between the lab's best. If you go, we won't have that anymore. It's not perfect, but there's no better way. "

"That's the thing. There is. Haven't you ever wondered what would it feel like to walk to a local convenience store and buy yourself some chips and talk to the normal kids in schools?"

"Seems like our time ran out, she's here. Oh no, she's with Bezdon. " As well as the combatants, a large chunk of block 85 arrives with them to watch the fight.

"It's not too late. Think about how much you could gain access to when you're outside."

"Even if you're right, it's irrelevant. Everyone expects the epic final battle and I can't disappoint them. I still appreciate you for your conviction and your trust, Adrian."

"It's been really nice talking."

Adrian sprints to Victoria and whispers something to her. She nods, and he sits to the sidelines to watch the fight.

"How was the shower? Are you feeling ready?" - Monica asks.

"Ready. Let's do this."

Vasiliy arrives from the crowd to stand near Monica. Monica summons 4 mage elementals to each side and 4 swordsmen in front. "I expected you to bring a stronger partner to the fight, so I brought backup too. Let's make this battle spectacular."

"The truth is, the game was rigged from the start." - Vasiliy comments.

"That definitely sounds like an obscure reference, nobody would ever say that before a battle." - Bezdon replies.

"I just did."

Bezdon and Victoria begin approaching their adversaries. Monica's elementals begin firing black fireballs at Bezdon, who promptly slaps them into nonexistence, while she begins casting a black flame explosion on the ground a bit ahead of Bezdon, expecting him to move right into the explosion zone. At the same time, Vasiliy begins attacking Bezdon's mood with his power.

"Don't even try it, dude."

"Shit, the void completely shields him!"

After getting close enough, Victoria launches a double ice maraca grenade at Monica. Too preoccupied with casting the black flame explosion, she notices it the last moment and manages to take step back, causing the explosion to activate prematurely. The grenade hits her knee, causing her to grab it for a few seconds, while the explosion happens right near Bezdon. Despite not being harmed by the explosion, he gets majorly startled by the sound and takes a step back. After recovering from the grenade, Monica launches a black flame comet at Bezdon, while the swordsmen elementals in front of her and the mages attack Victoria, with Vasiliy joining the onslaught of swordsmen shortly after. Bezdon tries to block it with his void tendrils, but it goes right through him, lighting him up on black fire and causing him to run around screaming and chaotically flailing his void tendrils everywhere. The other 4 mage elementals begin firing fireballs at Victoria instead. Dodging the fireballs, she pulls out 2 ice maracas, fuses them into one, and throws it at Bezdon, melting them into water midair. Despite somehow missing the tendrils and landing on target, the water only strengthens the black flames, causing Bezdon to scream louder, pull away his void tendrils and start rolling on the ground in pain, trying to extinguish the black flames, but by the time he does that, he is hurt too much to continue fighting. In the meantime, Victoria dodges a wave of incoming black fireballs and sends several barrages of ice shards into the swordsman elementals, dissipating them instantly, while Vasiliy blocks the ice shards instead with his shield. After he gets close, mage elementals cease firing to avoid friendly fire. He launches a slash at Vici, who deflects it with an ice shield and quickly turns the ice shield into an ice band around his sword arm. As he unsuccessfully tries to get it off, she puts another ice band on his other arm so she can grab his shield and throw it away, then she turns him around, grabs him under his arms and begins walking towards Monica, using Vasiliy as a human shield.

"Dude, what the fuck." - someone in the crowd says.

"I have harnessed the power of islamists in order to win the war! Death to the infidels, or something." - Victoria says with a sinister joy in her voice. Monica begins slowly spreading out her mage elementals so Victoria couldn't block the fireballs with Vasiliy.

"Vasiliy, is that against the rules?" - Monica asks.

"It's a war crime in the real world… But here, nobody even thought about it as a real tactic…"

"You won't have enough time to bring my mood down either, fuckface." - Vici tells Vasiliy, after he fails to attack her mood too.

"Oh for fuck's sake…"

At this point the mage elementals have formed a semicircle around Victoria, and shortly after, the ones with a clear line of sight fire at her. As a result, she walks back a little with Vasiliy so all the fireballs hit him instead.

"No-" - Vasiliy says in terror before all 4 launched fireballs hit him, leading him to scream from pain and fall on the ground after being let go of by Vici. Monica turns all the elementals into swordsmen and makes them charge at Victoria. As they're approaching, she forms a quintuple ice ball in her left hand, and right as the elementals get close, she takes another step back, throws the big ice ball and shatters it at the elementals, inflicting heavy damage. Monica launches a black flame comet to hit Vici at the same time with the swordsmen, but she hears the sound of the comet and side steps it to the left. The comet goes through 2 elementals, destroying them instantly, and Victoria finishes off the rest with several well-aimed shattering ice balls. She then proceeds to charge at Monica, ice maraca grenades in hand, and when she gets close enough, launches one into her as an ice maraca grenade and one over her head and shatters it into her from above. Monica launches a sheet of black flame to deflect the grenade, but the ice shards above her hit her head, staggering her for a good while. At the same time, Victoria realizes she is almost out of ice to throw, so she takes a pair of ice maracas in each hand and turns them into rectangular ice fists.

"Why do you want us all to remain trapped here forever?"

When the black flame sheet dissipates, Vici dashes at Monica and pretends she's about to throw a punch.

"I like it here! I've had more fun in the last 3 days than during the rest of my life."

Monica pulls out a smaller black flame sword from behind and slashes at Victoria with it, but this time with her left hand instead to throw her opponent off. Vici manages to react to the attack in time by ducking and punching Monica in the top of her right leg, then turns the fist into a tall bracelet, wrapped around the leg. Monica grunts from pain and launches a counterattack slash with the black flame sword. Victoria tries to deflect it with her left ice fist, but overextends the arm and deflects the hit with her unguarded arm instead. It doesn't manage to actually inflict any burning, but it does hurt a decent amount. Victoria steps back.

"Oh god, that hurts…"

"Don't you realize you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by siding with me?"

Attempting to ignore the pain, Monica creates another black flame sword of an identical size in her right hand. "I have everything I'll ever need here." Her voice is moderately strained.

"Bullshit." Vici comes a bit closer and launches a punch with her left fist. Right before Monica blocks the punch with her right sword, Victoria shatters it at her. The shards of the fist make her release a grunt of pain, but don't actually do much else. Monica launches a poke with her left arm sword. Vici is too slow to do anything about the poke and it lands on the bottom part of her torso. Monica tries to slash at her with the right hand sword, but Victoria manages to step back and pick up some of the few remaining ice maracas from her pockets to fill her hands. At this point they're both visibly hurt.

"We all watched the movies and shows of the simpler times. Everyone in the lab lacks something they could get if they left." - Victoria continues.

Monica steps forward and launches a diagonal slash with both of her swords. Vici manages to easily deflect both attacks at once with her ice shield. Powerless to resist, Monica gets an ice bracelet on her right arm from Victoria's left ice maraca, causing her to fall on the right knee, plunging her left sword into the ground vertically. Victoria also grabs the hurt part of her torso and steps back a little.

"No, I can't lose… The fate of the whole lab lies in my hands… The pain is crippling…"

"I know you've been wondering at some point in your life if you could have something from the outside world you couldn't obtain otherwise. Come on, we can get you whatever it is."

"You're not fucking losing this, Monica! Kick her ass!" - Vasiliy exclaims before using his powers to amplify her mood.

"Think about Krovoslawsky, Vici! Give her hell!" - Adrian telepathically tells Victoria.

Monica stands up as if she was unharmed. As she is standing up, Victoria throws a final shattering ice ball at Monica's face. Barely noticing the attack, she launches a dashing thrust at Victoria with both her swords. Having nothing to block the attack with, she sidesteps the attack the last second to the right and grabs Monica's right arm with both of her icy hands. Ignoring the damage, Monica relatively easily breaks free of the grab thanks to Victoria's dwindling strength, pushes Victoria away, and launches a sheet of black flame at her. Vici loses her balance and falls on her ass. After a short while, Monica sits on her knees. Both combatants are visibly tired and hurt.

"You will lose nothing… and gain everything. I know you wanted something… Maybe in your childhood, before your mom told you there's no way in hell… There is a way… Think about it…"

"Keep pushing, Monica! You almost got her!" - Vasiliy yells.

"I wanted… A chinchilla. It's like a fluffy and adorable rodent... I wanted one so bad."

"Never seen one… But we will get you one…"

"Now that I think of it, I always wondered what it would feel like to have a dog. They sound so playful and lovely. " - Vasiliy comments.

Monica stands up, walks out to Victoria, and stretches her out a hand. "I am with you."

Vici grabs her hand and stands up with her remaining strength. "Watch out, Moni, you will start feeling pain in a matter of seconds!" - Vasiliy says.

Victoria takes her hand, stands up, and breaks the ice bracelets on her opponent in half. The crowd is completely mesmerized by what they just witnessed. They stand holding their right hands for a second, before Monica begins screaming from the feeling of pain returning to her and falls back on the ground. Victoria helps soften the fall.

"Can I take the coin shards?"

"Yes… Search pockets… Someone help, holy shit…"

"You better fucking not be scamming us all, Victoria!" - Vasiliy exclaimed.

"Vasiliy, if you think about it for a moment, you'll realize that it would be a blunder of galactic proportions."

Vici finds the shards in her pockets and takes them into hers. Everyone claps. Adrian approaches Victoria and hugs her, while a bunch of Monica's classmates pick her up and start dragging her inside.

"I can't believe you did it!"

"I am still not sure if I won or not. I mean, she clearly sustained more damage, but I ran out of strength first."

"Who cares, I guess it's a tie. But we won!"

"Emphasis on we, and I don't mean that in a passive-aggressive way."

Next day, the school is back, and block 85 is sitting in class once again. Everyone is looking happy.

"Congratulations to our own block for winning the coin shard hyperwar! I watched the final fight with others, it was truly stunning. Victoria, I am amazed you didn't get lynched by everyone for using Vasiliy as a human shield. That was insane."

"If you think about it, it would have been a very hard case to make for GOEW to ban it. I have never seen anyone do that and I don't think anyone will do the same again."

Cut to the first break. Everyone is standing near Vici and Adrian with their phones.

"And that's the last of it."

"We've hit 20 thousand tokens, baby!" - Adrian exclaimed.

Everyone begins cheering. Even Victoria is shown smiling. "Your time is running short, Krovoslawsky. I will make sure to figure out the most mathematically painful way to kill you."

S1E17 Graduating the Lab

Everyone is still standing around Adrian and Victoria from the previous chapter. Victoria is seen calling her mom on a speakerphone.

"Yes, dear?"

"I got the 20 thousand tokens."

"I doubt it, that would require an insane amount of work. I don't think you're capable of anything like that."

"Then think again. It's true."

"Don't you guys have access to everyone's token balance? We're serious." - Adrian adds.

"Hold on… What in the sane hell… You do have 20484 tokens."

"Told you so." - Victoria says.

"Well, you did a great job collecting those! I am pretty sure that's the most amount of tokens anyone has ever had across all similar labs. I suppose you're calling me so you can see what the outside is like?"

"That's right. And don't forget our deal, it's me and anyone I want."

"Of course. We'll arrange everything in a couple of days. Congratulations on making it to this point!"

"Do I not have to have my tokens taken away or anything?"

"Oh, no, you can keep them. You can even spend some now. You deserve it." Everyone becomes pleasantly shocked.

"Okay, thanks, mom."

As soon as the call is over, everyone begins cheering again.

"Does this mean we have 20 thousand tokens we have no idea what to do with?" - Adrian asks.

"I have a few ideas."

"Can I have some money if you have too much?"

"Can I have some too?/Me!/I want some money too!/Please, give me some money!" - seemingly everyone in class starts asking.

"Let's make one thing clear. Me and Adrian will be in charge of this money and if you annoy us too much, it will really hurt. That said, I am giving you all 200 tokens to reward you for your support."

Everyone starts cheering and celebrating harder than ever before.

Victoria transfers everyone their promised money. Soon after, a stinger indicates that the next lesson is starting. Everyone is slowly heading inside.

"Let's think about ideas for how to spend our tokens during class." - Vici tells Adrian.

"Which class do we have?"

"Literature. I swear, if they give us homework to read some garbage like Crime and Punishment again, I am gonna obliterate my wrists with an ice knife. Getting any homework at all is awful already."

"Not before you obliterate mine- I am joking. We can always outsource it."

"Damn it, I should have done that the first time."

Cut to the duo sitting on their usual bench next school break, lists of paper in their hands.

"Got anything good?" - Vici asks.

"Sure do. Have I told you about the ice crown the dream version of you had?"

"You didn't mention anything about the crown then."

"Well, she had a crown helmet made out of pure ice and it was menacingly beautiful, and beautifully menacing. I was thinking, what if we get you a crown like that in real life, but cooler?"

"I never actually managed to decide what I should have as headwear, but that might just work. I am thinking a shining circlet from a white metal like silver or whatever is available, with a sapphire in the middle, and two diamonds to the side, then handcraft the actual crown helmet of ice around it."

"Could also do 2 sapphires to the side and a diamond in the middle."

"We'll think about the details later when I get to sketching it for them to make one for me. What else?"

"We just straight up give every significant kid with powers a thousand tokens. Or the more significant ones. Should still have plenty left for the rest. "

"I had the same idea, actually. Who do we got?"

Adrian starts counting with fingers. "Me, you, Nathan, Jason, Lumina I guess…"

"I agree about Lumina, actually, maybe we can finally make her fuck off that way. Also, we don't count, you can have anything you want from that money."

"Thanks, Vici. Bezdon, Akim, Gabriel?"

"He's not significant, but fuck it, he helped us against the pedo and sided with us in the war from the start."

"Vasiliy, Monica, Brian, maybe?"

"I honestly respect him for being an absolute menace to society. However, we can't give him too much money, since he will just give up on being an agent of chaos and live happily ever after until he turns 16. I say we give him something like 350."

"What if Sofi crawls out of the ground and says 'Hey um… I need about tree fiddy, give me the tree fiddy or I'll break your face'?"

"Shit, right, she would feel betrayed if she doesn't get a cut too."

"So we got 9, I think, plus Brian, which totals to 9 thousand tree fiddy tokens."

"We could make you better clothes too. You barely look different from a generic trooper, honestly."

Adrian looks down. "You're right, actually."

"Another one I have is to just have a giant party for someone's birthday. We just need to find someone who has their birthday today or tomorrow."

Adrian checks something in his phone. "Dude, it's my birthday tomorrow. December 13th."

"Really? Perfect."

Later, Monica is shown talking with the duo and having fun. In another clip, Victoria is giving Brian the 350, who happily accepts it. Next day, everyone is seen celebrating Adrian's 11th birthday in a lavish birthday party out in the open. He begins wearing a new set of clothes, which is just a standard shirt and pants colored dark purple with some pink. Later that day, Victoria is seen finishing assembling her new crown helmet near Adrian. She puts it on and Adrian is stunned by its beauty.

Next day in class, the teacher makes an announcement.

"Children, your parents have arranged for you what you wanted, thanks to Victoria fulfilling her goal of reaching 20 thousand tokens. Today, at 17 hours, you will all be free to join Mr. Jefferson near block 58, who will show you what you wanted, as we agreed with Victoria."

Everyone begins cheering.

"Will you guys handle our possessions for us?" - someone asks.

"Sure, of course."

Later that day, several hundred children are standing near the target block, waiting for Mr. Jefferson to lead them out. Victoria, Adrian and Monica are standing together.

"I gotta say, Vici, you are very strong in a fight. The ice bracelets you use hurt so much." - Monica comments.

"I try my best."

"Would you mind if I tell you how you could have won the fight without any doubt?"

"I am always looking to get more powerful and discover new abilities."

"Your offensive abilities are monstrously strong and your agility is on point, however, your strength seems to be lacking. You can't properly take a lot of hits. Assuming that one time you tried to punch my leg, your melee attacks also lack power. I barely felt that punch with your ice fist that you followed up with transforming the fist into a bracelet, which was amazing, by the way."

"I never had to take a beating because I almost always could protect myself with ice shields and avoid any damage, never tried using melee either, since the ice balls and the maracas were more than sufficient to deal with anyone in medium-short range anyway."

"Yes, but I am guessing you understand what was the problem in both of your fights against me: I am highly trained in both of those areas, and in order to defeat me or someone like me, you'd need more toughness and strength."

"A huge mistake I've made was not restocking on ice after Gary and the sewage kids. If I had more, there might have been a chance too."

"Do you just carry a ton of ice maracas in your pockets at all times?"

"Yea. Never know if some block launches a revenge assault on you specifically, need to always be prepared."

"Does it not get heavy or anything?" - Adrian asks.

"A little, but it's not nearly as heavy as you'd think, considering I have control over ice. That said, I appreciate your suggestion, Monica."

"You're welcome!"

"Dude, have you guys thought why are they allowing all of us to come at once? Do they have, like, several planes ready to be loaded with us and our cargo?" - Adrian asks.

"That is pretty weird that they managed to arrange us places to live as well as means of transportation in only a couple of days. They must really have the logistics under control." - Victoria comments.

"What's logistics?" - Monica asks.

"I also have no idea." - Adrian also says.

"It's how well you can move and structure moving stuff between places. "

"I am so happy have helped you guys achieve this. We will be so happy together on the outside." - Monica comments.

"Thanks for going along with us. I still can't believe that all this time you weren't trying to manipulate us and just genuinely fought for what you believed in. "

"Of course I was! I am really happy to see that you came around to understanding me."

Adrian comes closer to Monica. "You know what? Fuck it. You've proven that you actually don't suck as a human being. Don't know about Vici, but consider me a friend." He puts his hand on her shoulder. Monica produces a high pitched screech of joy.

"Honestly, I feel like we're surrounded by evil, corrupt, selfish, callous pieces of shit everywhere we go. I am all of those to one degree or another, and whatever Adrian was like before we became friends, I managed to properly ruin him too. "

"I don't feel like I've been ruined. I've never felt this confident in myself."

"Did you completely forget your training arc where you caused so much chaos that you got grounded for 3 days and almost had Kate kick the shit out of you? Embrace your moral darkness. The only people who matter in life are people you like, and everyone else can go fuck themselves."

"Wait, does that mean you like me too?" - Monica asks.

"You're interrupting me. You're the one person in this entire lab who completely doesn't suck. However, I can fix that by making you suck similar to how I do, just like Adrian. Would you-" Adrian smiles.

"YES, PLEASE!" - Monica says very loudly.

"Fuck's sake… Then consider me something of a friend too, I guess." She also puts her hand on Monica's shoulder, and turns her eyes away. Monica produces another squeal of happiness.

"Victoria of block B0085, step forward please." - someone says through a loudspeaker. Victoria shows Adrian and Monica a raised hand and moves towards Mr. Jefferson. "We have decided to grant you a front seat of your choice, if you wish one, aswell as to anyone you'd like. "

"Front seat to what?"

"We're gonna show you kids something. We will be going to a cinema hall."

"An educational video or something? Whatever. Give one to Adrian, Monica, and I guess Bezdon and Vasiliy."

Later, Bezdon, Vasiliy, Adrian, Victoria and Monica are seen sitting on the front seats in the cinema hall.

The video on the big screen begins. A map of the country of events is shown, which is basically 2020 russian borders plus entire eastern europe, excluding Greece, and with a big chunk of the far east bordering China being gone. "Welcome, children. Today we will be talking about the outside world. It's a really rough place. In many areas of our motherland, the Megaslavian Social Republic, poverty rates are very high, schools are underfunded and struggle to maintain order, children are often forced to work after school to help their parents meet their ends."

Everyone looks bored. Adrian gives Victoria his hand, which she accepts after a delay. Noticing that, Monica gives her a hand aswell, which she also accepts strictly out of boredom. "Child kidnappings are also very common, which lead to organ theft, rape or being forcibly indoctrinated into gangs or rebel organizations. But you know what doesn't have problems? That's right, it's the environment you are in right now! You have all the food and clothes and access to media you could ever want, aswell as ability to fight eachother between school, which very few schools on the outside condone! And when you grow up, you will be paid massive amounts of money as a reward for fighting the enemies of the motherland!"

"Don't trust anything they say here, we have no confirmation whenever it's true or not." - Victoria loudly whispers.

Fast forward to the end of the video. "So this is why you should be happy to be here! Thank you for your attention. "

"Oh, fucking finally." - Adrian says. Everyone, devastated from boredom, are happy to get up and leave. After leaving, Victoria and the 5 kids she chose to sit on the front seats approach Mr. Jefferson.

"Oh, hello, kids! Did you like the video?"

"It felt like a demonic manifestation of boredom ejaculating into my ears. Are we leaving now?" - Victoria asks. Everyone looks at her with wide eyes, except Adrian (he's used to it).

"Oh no, don't you get it? The outside world is horrible. Your lives will be so much worse out there and you will have so much less opportunities for fun. " The entire crowd of kids assembles around the adult and the kids on the front row.

"I will be the one to judge that, not you. Your attempt at dissuading me failed."

"I don't care the outside world is poor. The lab is boring and it sucks." - Adrian says.

"You never allow anyone to have domestic animals here, and there's a mountain of other reasons why we need to leave as soon as possible. " - Monica comments.

"There's around 600 kids here in total, probably less, plus like another 300 if you count the parents and teachers. Seriously, we want new people to meet opposed to the same motherfuckers whose faces we smashed yesterday and the day before." - Nathan argues.

"If people on the outside are so poor, then I will be their guardian angel. I will fight crime and take care of my giant white dog. You can't keep us here forever." - Vasiliy said with pride.

"We don't want to keep you guys here forever! We only want to keep you here until you're 16. Now, the show's over. Go home and return to your normal lives, kids." The adult walks away. Everyone gives him middle fingers, with some shouting insults at him.

"What do these dickfaces think they're doing?" - Adrian asks, angry.

"How could they do that to us? Are we not human to them?" - Monica adds, on the verge of tears.

"Dude, we just got pegged in the ass by the adults. Again." - Vasiliy says.

"Of course we were. How could I be so blind? They never wanted what's best for us, they wanted to raise us like this until we're old enough then waste our entire life energy on their stupid adult wars. We aren't human to them, we're only worth as much combat power as we can provide." - Victoria said with despair in her voice, covering her face mid sentence.

"They will pay for what they've done. " - Bezdon comments.

"I need to do something real quick. See you around, everyone." - Vici said, walking away.

"It's okay, Vici, we'll figure something out." - Adrian says.

"No, we won't. We're fucked. "

"We need to call an emergency meeting. Not just in GOEW, but between all block leaders. We can't and we won't let this slide." - Vasiliy said.

"Agreed. I am going to handle half the invitations. Vasiliy, you can handle the other half, plus tell everyone to stay put and await commands." - Adrian says.

"Who put you in charge- I am fucking with you, they screwed us all. Let's do this."

Victoria is seen walking somewhere alone, calling Brian on the phone. "Hey Brian, I need a favor as soon as possible. Where are you?"

"Evening! I am at my block. Didn't think they were serious with this whole outside thing. Was I right?"

"They weren't. Stay where you are, I am coming. "

"Of course, whatever is it you need, I'll help."

When she finally arrives at block 99, she sees Brian and approaches him. There's very few people at the block in the moment.

"Can we move aside a little?"

"Sure, of course, what's up?"

Victoria draws 2 ice maracas and turns them into a blunt sword of ice and points it at him. "Draw your sword."

"What?"

"Draw your sword. Pretend I just challenged you to a duel."

"Holy shit, okay." He complies and draws his rainbow sword.

"I am going to attack you now. Do your best to land a hit by any means necessary."

"Thank you for caring about me not getting in jail for this."

"You're going to jail when I say you're going to jail. Now attack."

Victoria dashes at Brian with her sword and throws a slash. He deflects the attack so hard that Victoria loses balance for a good while, after which Brian puts his sword onto her neck.

She gets on her knees. "Thank you."

"Enjoy the trip." Brian deactivates the sword and walks away.

Victoria closes her eyes, and in a few moments opens them again, causing them to shine rainbow.

Adrian is seen sitting at the same bench as usual in his block. He reads a message in global lab chat that says, "Victoria is rampaging across the lab again! She just annihilated 7 people near block 92, while spouting about how we all must die so her friends can live!"

"Oh FUCK." - Adrian bolts up and sprints in the direction of block 92, encountering a group of older kids running away from there.

"Wrong way, dude! You're gonna get blasted!"

"I know!"

He eventually finds Victoria rampaging through what's left of block 90 and finds Akim putting lightning landmines in an attempt to defend himself from her.

"Adrian, holy fuck, what's wrong with her?"

"If they give me a medal for killing you, maybe Adrian will be able to buy himself a cake." - Victoria says in a voice simultaneously full of sadness and hope.

"Oh my god, she's high on rainbow gas! What the fuck?" - Adrian realizes.

Akim fails to be able to defend himself with his powers, and eventually Victoria approaches close enough to throw several shattering ice balls at him, knocking him down. "Tell your government to drop some extra nukes on us after they fix you up."

"Adrian, good luck. It's the end of the line for me."

"I'll do my best!" He begins projecting into Vici's mind the following: "Vici, it's me, Adrian. You're hallucinating. Please wake up."

"Adrian, I am pretty sure they captured you and you have a gun held to your head right now, but don't worry, I'll raid your captors and free you. Oh, there's another hostile nearby." She notices Adrian and begins throwing ice ball grenades at him. Adrian begins sprinting towards block 99 and dodging them, while calling Brian. Vici chases after him.

"Brian, what the fuck did you do, why is there rainbow gassed Victoria running around destroying everyone?"

"She asked me to duel her! She was gonna destroy me if I didn't obey!"

"I am leading her to you right now, you need to do something!"

"Oh jesus. Okay, bring her here!" Adrian hangs up.

"Surrender yourself and I will bring you in alive. " - Vici says in a distorted tone.

When they finally arrive at block 99, everyone except Brian is gone.

"I can suck the gas out of her, but I need to be close!"

"Try to chase after her and grab her from behind!"

"For the glory of Megaslavia. " - Victoria spouts and starts attacking Brian.

"Oh god, oh fuck!" - he exclaims in terror.

After Adrian eventually managing to get behind Vici and grab her from behind, she puts away her ice maracas and puts her ice cold hands on his arms, trapping him. "Aw, should have seen this coming."

"Death is not scary. Death is the goal, and I will bring you closer to it." - Victoria continues. Brian doesn't dare approach them out of fear.

At the same time, Bezdon, Vasiliy and Monica arrive.

"Stand back, we'll try to incapacitate her!" - Vasiliy says. Monica summons 4 empty handed elementals near her.

"Just make sure she can't attack, I can reverse this!" - Brian yells.

"Fine!"

Vici lets Adrian go, shoves him to the side, and grabs her ice maracas. He stands up and goes to the side. "Turkish cyborgs are no match for the Empress of Frostbite."

Bezdon dashes at her and attempts to grab her with his void tentacles. She jumps over the lower tentacles and blocks the upper ones with a spiky ice shield she formed on the spot, causing the void tentacles to spill out black goo, causing Bezdon to stop doing anything for a moment. She then runs up to him and throws 2 ice grenades into Bezdon's face at the same time as he uses his lower tentacles to knock Victoria off balance. His tentacles get retracted and he falls on the ground, groaning in pain. In response, Monica's elementals dash at Vici.

"I hope the muslim afterlife doesn't suck, for your sake."

"She's even more of a menace when high!" - Vasiliy exclaims.

As the black flame elementals approach Victoria, she manages to quickly stand up and destroy them all with only a couple of shattering ice balls. While she is distracted, Adrian grabs her with his hands and falls on the ground with her, while Vasiliy joins the dogpile. Brian sprints closer to everyone.

"Now! Do it now!" - Vasiliy says.

"I live to fulfill the President's will." She tries to break free, but cannot. Brian gets in range, sits in front of her and begins sucking out gas from her with his mouth from a distance. "I die with my dignity anything but intact." - Victoria says, as the gas is leaving her. After a bit of time, she ceases struggling and falls unconscious, and everyone gets up from her. When she opens her eyes, she is lying face upwards, and sees everyone who tried to calm her down nearby squatting and sitting around her on their knees.

"Oh shit… Is this hell?" -

"In a way, it sort of is." - Brian comments.

"Welcome back, Vici. You're home now." - Adrian comforts her.

"Oh, you're safe… How many soldiers did I destroy while I was high?"

"Two thirds of a block in total, not counting those who ran away in fear. You've had more violent breakdowns before." - Vasiliy says.

"Does anyone have any alcohol? I'll pay good money."

"I can-" - Brian begins.

"Vici, we're in a major crisis. The adults have scammed us the hardest we've ever been scammed. Binging on rainbow gas and alcohol won't help us solve this." - Monica interrupts.

"We need to start a meeting between all the lab leaders and decide how do we retaliate and we need you at the forefront of the meeting." - Vasiliy says.

"Not all hope might be lost. There's one thing we can do. " - Victoria said.

"Now we're talking!" - Adrian said.

"Where's Bezdon? If you guys came, I feel like he should have come too."

"You penetrated his tendrils with your spiky shields. He is in the hospital now."

"Damn it, this is why we can't and don't use sharp weapons. "

Cut to Victoria, Vasiliy, Monica and Adrian giving every block leader a presentation outside without any equipment other than their phones. Everyone is sitting on the ground. A horde of other kids are standing a respectable distance away.

"As you all know, we're facing a crisis of a never before seen scale. Hundreds of soldiers were dragged to a cinema hall and forced to watch a boring educational video under the guise of them being let outside, and then ordered to go back to their daily lives. " - Vasiliy begins.

"Even if you haven't been scammed by this, someone in your block has been. The adults have done something unacceptable and shown that they give absolutely zero…" - Monica reads.

"...Fucks…" - Adrian says it for her.

"About us."

"I worked very hard for years to achieve freedom, initially for myself, then for anyone who wished to escape too. I sold kisses, I destroyed entire blocks on my own, I fought brutal battles, I extorted people. I did everything possible to get to 20 thousand tokens. My parents took advantage of the wording of our deal and showed us what outside is like with untrustworthy statistics and persuasion instead of letting us out. Not even just to see what would happen." - Victoria explained.

"In retaliation, we have decided to begin rioting the very next morning as well as declare lab wide peace between everyone underage. We need to stick together if we ever want to hope to receive any amount of respect and concessions from them." - Adrian said.

"The moment you wake up and get into the first lesson tomorrow, destroy and steal lab property. Attack adults. Show them your private parts. Piss, shit and ejaculate on the floor or on adults. If you're old enough, you can even have sex, preferably with someone of the same sex to get the message across better. " - Vasiliy said, with him being audibly confused about the last sentence. Most block leaders showed visible disgust. "I know, it's disgusting, which is why you have to do whatever you can to show them our resolve. If you can think of something even more vile that doesn't harm any of our comrades, do it. When possible, incapacitate adults, but try to stick to non-lethal means of fighting them."

"We're doing this not because we hate them and want all of them to die, we're doing this to set boundaries of what they're allowed and not allowed to do to us. They might beat us, revoke our privileges, put us in jail, maybe threaten to execute us, but the only way we will succeed is if we do this together. You can't allow yourselves to back out of this."

"The script for this speech will be sent to every single one of you so you can tell it to your blocks. We're counting on you, warriors, and with just enough effort, we shall be victorious." - Victoria finished, and everyone who was giving a presentation raised one of their fists in the air. Almost everyone clapped and did the same.

S1E18 Swords of the Starbloods

Adrian and his tablemates are eating breakfast as usual.

"So, you guys have a plan for today?" - Adrian asks.

"Sure do."

"I know what \*I am\* doing."

"They're up for a rude awakening."

As the boys leave their room, the chaos has already started. The teacher is seen fighting around 5 children at once, others are seen breaking equipment all over the place. Some are seen without their pants, one dude is seen pissing on the floor. While Adrian's tablemates join them in spreading random chaos, Adrian himself begins projecting porn into his teacher's head to contribute to the chaos. Eventually the teacher gives up, shoves everyone away, hides in the bathroom and locks the door.

"I told them these imps would be enraged. I told them we teachers would be the first to suffer their wrath. But nooooo, they just had to proceed and scam the strongest, most influential, most ruthless and most competent child in the lab along with half the lab. I am better than this job." - the teacher was telling himself while drinking from his hidden stash of hard liquor.

Victoria is then seen scratching doors with ice claws on the bottom, Adrian is seen smashing chairs against the ground, Nathan is seen trying to blow up the door outside with his fireballs. Suddenly, the parents start coming out of their rooms and start grabbing and cuffing children's arms and legs. They try to resist by fighting back and running away, but get quickly overwhelmed by the adults' superior strength. Victoria is seen putting an ice band on one of the adults' hands, which does nothing and she gets handcuffed along with the rest of them. When everyone is in cuffs, they're led to stand in formation on the bottom floor.

"You children have made the worst mistake of your lives!"

"It's jail time for all of you!"

"Adrian, how could you do this? We do so much for you and this is how you repay us?" - Adrian's mom asks.

"You adults can go fuck yourselves. You robbed us of a chance to see what the outside world is like, and now you're paying the price." - he responds.

"You're the ones who will pay the price. Hope you're ready for the big house!"

"The worst of you will almost certainly get executed, too. You really thought you could get away with it?"

All the children get shocked and scared. "You're not gonna execute us, the best of us have the potential to become killing machines of unfathomable power. You can't afford to lose us." - Victoria argues.

"We can kill everyone else and take away all your entertainment until you learn to comply."

"We're not fighting wars for mass murderers. We will kill ourselves if you try what you said. There's only one way everything is going back to normal: you bring me to the negotiating table and begin dialogue. I am the one responsible for all of this and if you want us to kill turks some shit in the future, you must cooperate with me or we will all refuse to cooperate with you. "

"How insolent! Does she speak for all of you? "

"Yes/Yea/Absolutely!" - everyone said.

"I am following Victoria to hell, if I have to! Fuck you, adults!" - Adrian exclaims.

"You're about to learn a lesson we all learnt long ago: never piss off Victoria." - Nathan said.

"You lying sons of bitches will never get away with this! You will never break the indomitable spirit of this lab's warriors!" - Kate yelled.

"We'll just see how indomitable your spirits are when you're all thrown into prison!"

"Why don't you shut your dick licking mouth and do it, pussy?" - Victoria dares the adults. One of them comes to her and slaps her across the cheek.

"Who put you in charge, little girl?"

"The more times you hit me, the more I shall demand on the negotiating table. You're not in control of the situation." She gets slapped again. "You think this hurts? Our combined pain of being cheated by you is a thousand times stronger." She gets slapped again. "Slap me again and I will demand the right to execute you personally."

"You know you're out of your mind, right?"

"I am a future killing machine who will annihilate the Motherland's enemies by the hundreds, maybe thousands. You? You're just a government's pawn whose entire purpose is to keep us in check and do whatever white collar bullshit you do while you're not busy handling us. I have objectively more value than you. "

"That's my mom, you bitch!" - Lisa commented.

"She betrayed you and all of us, Lisa. I saw you go to the cinema hall with everyone. She is as much of a good mother to you as I am a white pony with rainbow mane."

Silence. "Don't think you will get away with this rebellion, Victoria! Our superiors will know about this!"

"Try me, pussy."

Cut to several hordes of kids are seen being transported to a jail adjacent to the lab. The block 85 kids are seen entering the jail first. After 2 blocks enter, an officer in a black military uniform, several shiny medals and a snazzy hat is seen arriving from the open gate leading to the jail. The gate looks extremely bland, as it was designed to not stand out from the walls near it. He eventually halts everyone entering.

"Gentlemen, we have a problem. The jail is only intended to house 40 prisoners at a time, it can handle 80 if we really push it but not any more. We won't be able to house them all."

"We had no idea, actually. I am gonna have to call the command center so they can give us orders on what to do with the little demons."

The kids are then seen locked in their rooms alone without access to toys, their PC's and every other source of entertainment made inaccessible. Meanwhile, Adrian, Kate and 2 of his tablemates are put in a single jail cell intended for 2, uncuffed and locked inside by random parents.

"Oh no, we're about to share a cell together. This is awkward." - Adrian comments.

"Wait, why? Come on, Adrian, we're in this together! We're all on your side." - one of his tablemates comments.

"He's probably talking about me, \*name\*. It's okay, Adrian, I am also on your side." - Kate says with minor sadness.

"I appreciate you respecting our decision for peace against the adults. You can always kick my ass later."

"Why would I do that? Dude, do you even know what you guys done together?"

"Drama, drama!" - the other one of Adrian's tablemates comments.

"This should be good!" Both of them listen to their dialogue in awe.

Ignoring the remarks, Adrian comments, "Okay. Tell me where I did something wrong."

Kate facepalms. "Oh my god. Look, I really wish you had the ability to stand up for what you believe even a little when faced against someone with an opposing opinion, however, even if you only followed what Victoria did without consideration of whether it's right or wrong…"

"I can assure you, I genuinely wanted to see what life on the outside is like and being scammed out of the opportunity left me as appalled as everyone."

"Awesome. As I was saying, fucking amazing job, dude, standing up for the entire lab, despite the risk of jail or even death at the hands of the scumbag adults. The pair of you can sometimes be really evil and selfish, and I absolutely did not expect the reveal that you wanted to let us see the outside world. I thought it was some sort of an intricate scam. "

"Hey, you sound exactly like her when we met Monica!"

"Perhaps, but the key difference is, during the coin shard war, Monica has been a completely new player on the battlefield, so her true intentions could be whatever you can think of, while Victoria has been consistently known for the last couple years as an absolute scourge on the lab who did everything necessary to suck out as much money out of everyone with no remorse."

Adrian smiles. "That's her, alright. I still remember how she took over our block and extorted all of us for a lot of tokens."

"And yet despite all of this, in the end, you were doing it for the sake of justice and everyone's prosperity. I am really confused about what I should think about you two as a result, but I think we can be friends again. " She smiles.

"Can't say I didn't miss you. As much fun as it is to have a sociopath as Victoria as your best friend, I really need exposure to other people so I don't become her gender swapped version." He stretches her out a hand for a handshake. Instead, she comes close and embraces him. The other 2 boys start clapping.

"Oh my god, they're not at each other's throats anymore!"

"Can you two, like, not patronize us?" - Kate asks.

"Dude, it's like we're a part of some sort of shitty reality tv show from the early 21st century."

Kate escapes the hug and looks towards the cell door. "I know, right? Hey, cameraman, don't forget to follow us to the jewelry store and watch us argue over whether a diamond necklace would fit me better than a ruby one or not!"

"Yea, and then we get mad at eachother and start throwing gilded tableware!" They both laugh. The other 2 boys look delighted too.

Cut to Victoria being led to an interrogation room somewhere in the prison by more men in black military uniforms, her hands still cuffed behind her back, but her leg cuffs being gone for the sake of being able to get her to the destination faster.

"Nice uniforms, but a turd in a cool suit is still a turd in a cool suit."

"Shut up! Your time to talk will come in the interrogation room. "

"Go fuck yourself."

When they enter the interrogation room, an empty, bland room with a lot of black tinted windows and a large table. There's one chair to one side, 2 to the other, the right one being occupied by Monica.

"Moni? What are you doing here?"

"Same as you, Vici. Same as you."

"We were ordered to remove your cuffs now. I wouldn't recommend escaping or attacking us, the building is locked down and we will hit you very hard if you do that."

"The only ones running here will be you, from your integrity."

"The fuck?" - the soldier asked in confusion.

"Dude, we're just simple soldiers. We follow our orders, and our orders are to stop you from breaking out if you try. Are you going to run on us or not?"

"No, you fucking deadbeat, I will not." - she said with even less emotion in her voice than usual.

"Good." One of them uncuffs Victoria. She calmly sits down near Monica and gives the soldiers a middle finger. The soldiers leave and lock the door.

"Do you even have experience in negotiation?" - Victoria asks Monica.

"Very little. I managed to convince my mom to give me a discount for when I was buying my phone because I was being a good girl, but that's my greatest accomplishment in that field."

"Well, you're here now, so listen up: if they execute me, they will lose one of the stronger future soldiers they have ever created and will make the rest of the lab angry at them for all of their lives. If they kill you, they will also lose a future death machine, and the rest of us will really, really hate them for it. Be honest about how you feel about them scamming us, but also don't forget that you don't have any value to them beyond how many enemies of the Motherland you can kill in the future, and if you admit that you don't want to defend Omnislavia in combat, you will be killed or possibly worse."

"Oh gosh." - she said in fear.

"This is not the time to think about or discuss your adult life. This is the time to discuss how to save your childhood from being unfullfilling. And remember: we want to live on the outside and we will not agree to any terms that give us anything less. Any offer of half-assed concessions is a clear sign of their disrespect for us."

"I understand. Thank you." Monica says, with minor anxiety in her voice while putting her hand on Victoria's shoulder.

"And in case it's not obvious, it's best if I lead the negotiation while you drop some supporting points or emotional comments here and there, but stick to what I told you and never give them anything they can use as an argument against us."

"Oh, I really didn't think there would be this little room for error. How am I meant to get through this?" - she asked with now very audible anxiety.

Victoria looked around and thought for a moment. "Fuuuuck… Damn it." She moves her chair closer to Monica and embraces her, pleasantly surprising her. "Please tell me you feel better."

"I do, thank you." - she answered with a bit of tears of joy.

"You're not fucking falling apart under pressure, got it? You're a god damn warrior and you are stronger than their bullshit, and you're getting that fluffy mouse one way or another. As well as the rest of the perks of being outside, of course." She lets go of her. "Forget I ever did this to you. "

"Of course."

Eventually, the interrogator arrives and sits down and puts his turned on phone against a wall, with some sort of volume meter on screen. He's also wearing a black uniform and has several medals on him.

"Greetings, I am captain Žigutis. This is The Negotiator. "

Silence. "I am The Negotiator, and I am here to resolve this situation efficiently. You may see yourselves as rebels against tyrants. To us, you are valuable, but replaceable. The more you resist, the harsher the response will be, and I assure you, patience is wearing thin. However, there is still a path where you avoid the worst outcomes while regaining some of what you've lost. Work with us, and we can find a way forward that doesn't end in destruction-for you or your future." - the phone begins talking in an intentionally robotic voice, but not annoyingly so.

"I don't think your stupid clanker ass was told that by the time we become adults ourselves, we will be omnipotent soldiers who would be invaluable defenders of Omnislavia. It's in your best interest to grant us the little concessions we require so we can move on towards our destinies and pretend none of this ever happened." - Victoria said confidently.

"Oh jesus. What are the little concessions you're asking for?"

"Every single one of us who desires so is allowed to be settled in a city or a town of your choice as long as the population is above 50 thousand. We will be free to go to any of the normal stores, buildings, etc, aswell as interact with other kids and other people, and we will have none of the arbitrary restrictions like no domestic animals. In turn, I know you have military schools all over probably, we will move to any one of them that you choose, and if problems arise, we can always renegotiate that later."

The interrogator laughed. "You want some free daily ice cream along with all that aswell? Tell them, Negotiator."

Artificially prolonged silence. "Victoria, you are correct in one thing-your future combat abilities are valuable. But value is not the same as leverage. You are demanding integration into society when you have yet to prove you can function within it, and no one here is in a rush to hand you that privilege. However, I am willing to explore a controlled transition-one that ensures discipline, loyalty, and security remain intact. You may not get everything you want, but if you are willing to cooperate, we can discuss a structured path forward instead of a fantasy of immediate freedom."

"We are going to get everything we request, as these are the minimum requirements. Got it?" - Monica commented.

"That's right. Here's another part where you're wrong: our value is our leverage. I suggest you analyze livestreams of my fights and my general reputation in the lab. If this is what I am capable of when I am 10, imagine how fucked will be your enemies when I am full grown." - Victoria explains.

Aritificially prolonged silence. "Do you have any comments about your transition towards being able to live around normal people like you desire?" - the captain asks.

"It all depends on how much time it will take and how painful you will make it. Assuming the rest of the concessions are granted and the terms of this transition are acceptable, that can work."

"Negotiator?"

Artificially long silence. Monica begins sleeping on the desk. "Your confidence is expected, but confidence alone does not dictate terms. The reality is that your power only matters if it can be controlled, directed, and trusted-not just feared. A transition will happen on our terms, at our pace, and with conditions that ensure you remain an asset, not a liability. The question is not whether you will get everything you demand, but whether you will choose to work within a system that allows you to build the future you claim to want. Refuse, and you might find that even the strongest weapons can be left to rust."

"This is the third time you cuntheads are using this bluff on me. It's not gonna work."

"You're threatening children with execution. What is wrong with you? How do you expect the rest of us to fight for you if this is how you treat us?" - Monica asks.

"Don't forget that we are still in control. That said, I don't fundamentally see any issues in your offer, only in your attitude. Let's discuss the terms of our transition."

"How do you manage to be this insolent when talking with your superiors?" - the captain asked.

"How do you manage to keep being a choosing beggar when the cards are stacked against you is a better question."

"Nuh uh."

"Yeah uh."

"Negotiator, suggest terms and the duration for their transitioning. "

"Your transition will be gradual and structured, not an overnight handover. First, you will be relocated to a controlled urban environment-limited in scale, monitored, and with clear rules. You will earn expanded privileges through discipline and compliance, not through defiance. Full integration into society will be assessed on an individual basis, and failure to meet expectations will result in restrictions being reinstated. The duration? That depends entirely on how well you adapt."

"Jesus. Where did you get this dumbass clanker?" Both of the girls look frustrated and bored.

"I have been assembled by the AI Department of Omnislavia in order to assist the Motherland's military and government servants with their needs. My real name is Molot D6-2. Perhaps one day you will have me to help you with your tasks aswell."

"One moment." Vici brings her chair closer to Monica again, begins gently scratching the table with her nails to create noise and very quietly whispering right in her ear, nearly touching it with her lips in order to avoid everyone else listening. "They're using the chatbot to drain our mental energy by frustrating us with its irritability. Don't give in. Laugh to relieve frustration if you feel like it. We might be here for hours, maybe until nighttime if they're especially cruel." Monica nods.

Cut to Adrian and his cellmates sitting in a circle and visibly having fun.

"Alright, alright, here's my turn. First, I've had 2 kids with powers as my friends throughout my life. Second, I've made at least 150 tokens in the kissing business before we won the war and got infinite money from Victoria. Third, I've been drawing on swords since I was 3." - Kate says.

The boys start thinking.

"Three."

"One."

"Two." - Adrian guesses.

"Aaaand Adrian got it! I've been drawing since I was 3, not on swords, though, and I've also been friends with Victoria like waaaaay back, sum her with Adrian and Lumina and that's more than 2."

"Oh, dude, right, you were the popular girl back in the day before Lisa and Victoria and whoever else. "

"Meanwhile I've been a generic, worthless trooper all the way until, just under a year ago?" - Adrian commented.

"I coulda sworn you hung out with everyone until you said something weird one day, everyone looked at you weird and then you were like nope, I am out."

Adrian covered his face with hands. "Oh god, that was so horrible, I don't wanna remember…"

"I mean, we all had bullshit like that when we were younger. It's how we cope with the consequences that matters." - the other tablemate of Adrian said.

"There's no changing the past. You can only move forward, Addie. Now, I don't know or don't remember what happened back then, but look at us now. Do we look like we even remember what it was?" Adrian uncovers his face.

"I do, actually. " - one of the other boys said.

"Okay. Do we look like we even care what it was?"

"No. Thank you, everyone." - Adrian responded.

Meanwhile, Vasiliy is lying on his bed with nothing to do.

"I don't know if there's a god or not. We were raised as christians, yet never been forced into said religion, as God doesn't like intervening in our lives and our allegiance to our country is much more important than our religion. Whenever it's Jesus, Allah, Moses, or perhaps the spaghetti monster the Iron Fist worships, or even an eldritch god of some sorts, please, let Victoria succeed. If she loses, we all will. Our value as human beings shall be reduced to as much value the imperial russian serfs had, only except farming all our lives, we shall fight all our lives. Considering our higher life expectancy combined with, well, being soldiers, I wonder if our lives shall be longer or shorter on average?" - he's thinking.

Meanwhile, Bezdon is lying in bed in his room too, but with all his toys still around. After doing something on his phone for a while, he stands up and walks up to the window to peek outside. Not a single living being in sight.

"So, she went ahead and did what we were all thinking we should have done. What I didn't expect is her somehow managing to get so many soldiers to agree to riot that they shut the whole lab down. She has bigger metaphorical balls than all of us combined at the same time as having no physical balls, unless girls have them inside of them or something. We were always taught that fighting the authority was punishing, fruitless and immoral, and yet, she dared. I know she's very smart, maybe the smartest kid we know, she wouldn't do anything unjustifiably risky. It didn't seem to me like she is in the mental state where she doesn't care if she lives or dies yet. Perhaps, she is gambling with the lives of people that care about her, or perhaps, she knows exactly what she is doing and has it all under control. If it's the second, I would have loved to side with her in this. Since when does she know how to create fucking spiked ice shields, by the way? And how did she even get rainbow gassed?"

Back in the interrogation chamber. Both girls look exhausted. The dude who led the interrogation was swapped for a different one because the previous one was too exhausted too.

"So let me get this straight. You're not accepting the deal if we track and watch every single one of you we let on the outside?" - the new dude asked.

"We're fucking people, not rogue AI's, not wild animals, not whatever else you take us for. We won't start a rebel organization just because you will let us out of sight for 2 seconds. Do we demand having access to vacations every summer or a dacha out of town from where we could be making weed and selling it to high school students? No, we don't. Every single time we ask you something simple, you tell us that we're breaking your balls. Every single time we double down on our demands and refuse to concede them, you instantly think up a way to fulfill it while making our lives as miserable as possible. Clanker, why won't you summon a clanker that considers people's feelings and emotions in your negotiations?" - the fatigue in her voice is very audible.

"Feelings and emotions are luxuries that come after order, not before it. If your demands were truly simple, we wouldn't be here having this discussion for this long. You claim you don't want to break our system, yet every negotiation with you is a battle of escalation. So tell me-what guarantee do we have that, once we concede, you won't push for more? If you want trust, prove you're worth it." - the Negotiator answered.

"Well, maybe let's start with the fact that you have never fucked us over harder than you did yesterday, which is the reason why you're negotiating this with me right now in the first place. You have pissed off an uncountable amount of people who all stand behind me, which is what's giving me all this leverage, and the only way you can make things go back to normal is by conceding to our demands. Likewise, the only way for us to gain this kind of leverage against you again is if you somehow manage to anger us equally as hard next time. Do you know how difficult it is to go against someone who you have been told since birth is an unstoppable force? It's not something we will be able to do with a fingersnap. Oh man, can I get any food, please?"

"Not until we come to a deal." - the interrogator responded, also fatigued.

"I am not tolerating you being choosing beggars anymore. You clearly lack the respect for us and don't care about our happiness at all. I am pretty sure we went over every single object of discussion and clanker here has noted them all. If you don't feed us or don't agree to my demands, we will also demand a sum of money equal to the price of a mid-range car every week, and if this goes on for another day, we'll demand twice as much, another and it's gonna be thrice as much. Agreeing on how much that is will be long and tedious, so I recommend just conceding to what I asked."

The Negotiator continued making demands, downplaying the girls' ones and belittling their leverage, all the while spewing more needlessly long texts. Monica begins trying to answer, but Vici pinches her shoulder to shut her up. The Negotiator continued. The girls stayed silent. Eventually, Monica grabbed the phone with the Negotiator and muted it. When the interrogator finally noticed it in his exhaustion, he took the phone from her hand and said:

"What do you think you're doing? You're touching government property without permission. "

"You're literally starving children into submission and think you're the one with the moral high ground? You really need to go home and reconsider your life." - Victoria comments.

The dude leaves the interrogation room into a hallway with a lot of doors along with his phone. He calls a higher-up.

"Sir, we have been unsuccessful at making them drop any demands at all. We have managed to get some of our demands accepted, but they're just straight up not cracking, only getting more annoyed. Victoria is leading the discussion and doesn't shut up about how we're choosing beggars and how we would be massively shooting ourselves in the foot by executing any of them. We've been going in circles for long enough for her to lose her patience and give us an ultimatum to feed her or concede or she will start demanding more money. Permission to move her to a different lab and pretend we killed her?"

"No, dumbass, you can't do that, every single subject with powers has something connected to their brain which allows them to kill themselves if they focus their mind on it hard enough, so the enemy has less to work with if they capture one of them dead. There's a very high risk the kids will discover that and they're way too expensive to risk like that." - the voice of the higher up sounds anything but sober.

"So, do I agree to their demands?"

"Now, the first thing you do is get them some food, and not the inedible slop we feed to the ones in jails, something that the staff members of the facility eat. Has the AI offered them a ton of money yet so they drop some of the demands?"

"No, sir."

"Tell it to try that out and let's get this over with. God damn devils… "

"Sir, yes, sir."

The interrogator comes back into the room with 2 dishes with synthetic chicken, a fork, and 2 butter+cheese sandwiches each. He gives the girls the food.

"Smart move. Maybe you're not so stupid after all. " - Victoria says. Nobody is eating anything yet.

"Bon appetit. How long do you need to eat?"

"Let's say 10 minutes."

"Got it. Please, girls, let's finish this already. "

"It all depends on you and the clanker."

He leaves. Victoria bites into one of the sandwiches, but Monica just closes her face with her hands.

"Oh god… Do they want to poison us? Are they so tired of us saying how valuable we are so they want to kill us and see what happens? Have I failed everyone by going with this?"

Vici stops eating, finishes chewing the part of the sandwich in her mouth, moves closer to Monica and puts her arm behind her back, plus her other hand on her leg.

"Moni, I told you, killing us would be a horrible mistake. They've conceded to give us food, which means they realized that making us more pissed off isn't their go to plan anymore. Keep it fucking together for just a half an hour or so more, an hour at absolute worst, and we won." She shakes Monica in an attempt to restore her mental capacity for sitting through more of this interrogation. In turn, she opens up her face and puts her arm behind Vici's back. Her face lacks any tears, but the effects of mental torture became very obvious.

"I don't know if I can take more of the randomly generated spout from this fucking AI. It's horrible. I have never felt more pain in my life. It's one thing being beaten with wooden swords, a whole other thing having your patience and focus tested and annihilated. "

"I am not letting you crumble for as long as I fucking live. If you have to, we can finish this whole ordeal sitting like this. You're a warrior, and life is testing the limits of your willpower. Show them all that hitting these limits isn't so easy. Come on, it's gonna be okay. I got you."

"Thank you. I've never had anyone care about me so much."

"Oh fuck. Please don't tell anyone else that, aside from Adrian maybe. I am supporting you because I respect you on several levels and are just straight up awesome, not because I have a big heart or some shit. I fucking don't. Either way, let's eat our food."

Eventually, the same interrogator comes back and sits back down on his chair. Monica is seen embracing Vici. While Moni looks comforted and happy, Victoria looks focused. "Did you like the sandwiches and the chicken?" - the interrogator asked.

"It was good enough, considering I expected you to pick up a few snails from ground and feed them to us to maliciously comply with our request to get food, but maybe you have at least a little respect for us." - Vici answered.

"Are you two, like, a thing now?"

Monica became visibly confused, while Victoria raised her eyebrow. "Why would you thinjWe're not a \*thing\* or anything of the sort. I mean, I am not gonna lie, she's hot as shit-"

Awkward silence. The interrogator stared at her. "What I meant was… Ummm… Her black flame comets are hot as shit. I still haven't mentally recovered from being hit by one. Anyway, are we ready to continue?"

Everyone went back to normal, either ignoring or dismissing the Freudian slip.

"Negotiator, say the thing." - the interrogator requested.

"Let's talk practicality. If your goal is to integrate into society with as much freedom as possible, then we're prepared to give you two, and only you two the kind of financial backing that ensures you won't just survive-you'll thrive. We're talking about enough money to give you luxury, independence, and options to experiment and have fun in ways most people your age could only dream of. You'll walk into this new life not just as warriors-in-training, but as individuals with the means to enjoy it, and all we ask is for only the two of you to be allowed outside, while we downplay the entire situation inside the lab like it was all an intricate scam you've handcrafted and everyone goes back to their daily lives, with us avoiding most of the blame. Think about what kind of a lavish teenhood you're going to have, and then tell me, is holding out for every last demand really worth more than having the resources to shape your own future?"

Monica got back into her normal sitting position. "You are asking us to literally sell all of our friends for what you claim is a boatload of money. My friends are everything to me. Not happening."

"We can always bring one or two extra closest friends of yours and add them to the deal, it's no issue at all." - the interrogator commented.

"Dude, she's friends with her entire block, you're gonna have to cut them all into the deal, which would ultimately defeat the purpose. You can't cut Moni off from the deal instead and only allow me to take whoever I want with me either, she's not someone I am willing to throw under the bus. Will there be anything else?" - Victoria asked, her patience restored, but her mental energy still nearing the end.

"In that case, we agree to all the terms. I'll go and print a document with every single point we've agreed upon and hand it to you for you kids to read."

"Awesome."

After he leaves, Victoria puts her arms on the table and puts her head on them. "Fuck's sake, it's finally over. Finally, no more Clankypants." Monica is just breathing deep, staring at the ceiling and not saying anything.

Back to Adrian's cell. He is taking a nap on one of the beds, while the rest of them continue playing on the floor.

"Attention, new arrivals. We have managed to broker a deal with Victoria and Monica and have been forced to agree with every single demand of theirs. Your access to your phones has been restored and you were all sent a document with all the details. You shall all be released in 15 minutes and returned to your blocks. Please don't cause more damage, we only want what's best for you." - the jail loudspeakers announced.

Everyone cheers. "Dude, holy shit that was loud. Owch." - Adrian says, standing up and joining his cellmates shortly after.

"This might have been another scam. Let's read this supposed document." - Kate suggests. Everyone opens their phones and begins reading the document.

"A maximum of 4 kids shall be released every week to live in government-provided middle class housing? Dude."

"Vici said that it was weird that they claimed they could transport and settle several hundred of us after only a few days. I don't know how hard it is to arrange for one soldier to move out to the outside, but it's possible they're actually just doing the best they can." - Adrian commented.

"She sent a voice message in labwide chat! Let's listen!" - Kate said, turned up her volume and played the voice message.

"Afternoon, everyone. This is Victoria and Monica." - she began.

"Hi, guys! Here's proof this isn't an AI recording designed to trick you." - Monica made a sound which sounded like someone trying to pronounce keyboard spam without much effort put into it.

"We won. They tried to agree to our demands while adding horrendous conditions and kept pretending we weren't the ones in control the whole time, but in the end, we've made it with the best deal we could have realistically extracted."

"Once you're free, please don't attack any adults. There's no more reasons to do so."

"Thank you all for participating in this."

"You guys are the best! Vici did amazing too, they were no match for her iron will!"

"Well, that's enough of that. Congratulations, everyone." The voice message ended.

"I told you. We fucking won, dude!" - Adrian said. Everyone cheered and started a group hug. The inhabitants of the cell across were also jumping from joy and making sounds of happiness. Shortly after, sounds of claps started approaching Adrian's cell, and Victoria appeared.

"There she is!" - Adrian's tablemate noticed.

"You saved us all!" - Kate exclaimed.

"I did. I don't know if you read, but I've requested for you four to remain here for 3 months for being dickheads to me in the past. Have fun rotting in here.

Everyone but Adrian was shocked, while he wheezed. "Damn it, Adrian, next time try to play along so we can extract more funny images of their flabbergasted faces. I would have loved to hear the angry insults they were gonna hurl at me."

"You totally fucking got us, bro!" - one of Adrian's tablemates said.

"I don't know how he could tell right away, this was too lifelike!" - Kate commented with relief.

Later, Adrian and Victoria are seen sitting together on a bench. Everyone around them is seen and heard celebrating the victory.

"Honestly, using a primitive AI like that in negotiations should be considered a form of torture." - Victoria suggested.

"I can imagine that wasn't fun. But hey, you did it!"

"Sure did. Thanks for sticking with me this whole time. We did something great today."

"You're always welcome. You know, I've been thinking lately, and we do have common friends now, and you haven't told me that I have something more to learn about you, so…

You know… Wanna get on the next level?"

"Oh shit, I completely forgot about that. I really didn't expect this, what do I do…" She covers her face with hands.

"What's the problem? I can accept rejection if that's your decision."

"Do you seriously think so or are you just saying that to make me feel better?"

"Yea, you caught me. I'd be upset." - he replied sadly.

"Alright. This doesn't feel right discussing it with you, but it'd be even worse to not discuss it with anyone at all, so fuck it. Do you know why I am so overwhelmed by this request?" She uncovers her face and gives Adrian a hand. He accepts it.

"Because I am a worthless dork who doesn't deserve you?"

"No, if that was the case, a 'no, get away from me before I murder you' would have sufficed. I think while we were sitting there on those chairs, I developed a crush on Monica."

Adrian shrugged. "Can't blame you."

"See, you understand. But also, I don't want to reject you because it will drive a wedge between us and I just cannot afford it."

"Heh. So it's not a coincidence, you do swing both ways?"

"Yea. Girls are just cute. But so are you, just in a different way."

"Aw, thanks. Look, if you feel like being with her, go for it. From what you described to me, if you force yourself into a relationship with me, it will inevitably be very toxic and painful for you. That will drive an even bigger wedge between us. "

"It seems I taught you well about the nature of relationships and sex. However, you are the best thing that's ever happened to me, so it's not really forcing myself into it if I actually do like you. It's just that picking either option would mean I would be locked out of the other, and I don't know how would it be possible to choose both."

"Didn't you say she's only going with us when she can take her entire block with her?"

"Oh, right. Well, I am not sitting here for another month so we can go with her, so I suppose right now it's obvious who I have to choose. Welcome to not being single." She looks at him.

Adrian hugs her. "Yay! So, what do we do now?"

"I don't know. I don't think I had that part explained to me."

"Wait, seriously? Thought you were the expert."

"I kind of am, but I mostly know advanced rules and guidelines, not what to do when you just get into a relationship. It feels like I know every other important aspect, but not this."

"Damn. I guess we continue hanging out like normal, and holding hands?"

"I guess."

"It's interesting how it's not often I find you not fully confident in what you're doing or saying."

"Most of my life, I've been doing my best to understand the world by researching the mechanics of life and civilization, kind of like how one learns the mechanics of a new RPG. However, it seems like relationships can't be fully understood that way before you jump right into them, maybe at all. They're magical, and you can expect anything and everything to happen. I know a lot about them, but we're still probably just gonna have to improvise and overcome our adversities together. As always. "

"As always."

"So, who are we taking with us?"

The duo, now with their hands held together, approach Kate, who's chatting with her girl friends.

"Hey Kate, wanna join us in the first four who leave the lab?" - Adrian asks.

"I mean, I would, but I don't know if they will let me go…"

"The question is, Kate, do \*you\* wanna go?" - one of her girl friends asks.

"Why wouldn't I want to? I just don't want to leave you all alone."

"We'll catch up to you in time, it's not like it's a goodbye "

"Got it. Then count me in!"

Kate and Victoria shake hands, and Adrian happily embraces Kate.

After that's over, they approach Jason. He is seen dueling a blockmate for sport. After Jason wins, he turns to Adrian and Victoria.

"Afternoon, saviors of the lab! Since when are you two holding hands?"

"Since like, 30 minutes ago." - Vici replied, smiling.

"Oh awesome, congratulations! Anyway, here to chat?"

"We were wondering if you'd like to be in the first 4 to leave the lab with us." - Adrian asks.

"Absolutely! I am really happy you think I am important enough for that. What about the rest of you who organized the riots?"

"They've agreed to let us pick our closest friends this week. Bezdon and Vasiliy are moving out next week, and Monica moves out when the spots for most of her block are organized. "

"Either way, I am down! Thanks for choosing me!"

In a few days, the chosen four are standing near the exit from the lab, surrounded by their friends and others.

"Bye, Adrian! We'll drink some lemon juice in the name of you and your victory." - Nathan said.

"Hope this isn't the last of you dipshits I see. Wouldn't it be cool for like any 3 of us to defeat an entire grade of students all on our own? "

"Oh we're coming to you as soon as we can, and then we will kick your ass together for leaving us behind, ha ha ha!" - one of Adrian's tablemates said.

"Sounds like you're too much of a coward to fight me one on one. "

"You wanna go, brah?"

"No, I have a helicopter to catch, but the moment we reunite, I am gonna shove my sword so deep up your ass that you're gonna puke it out of your mouth." - he answered playfully.

Meanwhile, Victoria tells Monica:  
"Stay safe out here. I'll have someone find out where and how to buy chinchillas for you."

Monica energetically embraces Vici.  
"I'll miss you. It's been amazing to get to know you and work with you."  
"Sister, don't even start."

The 4 kids get into a tandem rotor military helicopter and sit down in the back, along Adrian's and Kate's parents.

"Murmansk, here we come." - Adrian says with determination.

Somehow integrate anti white racism maybe?

Weapon usage:

Lasers: best choice against drones and unarmored missiles, too expensive against pretty much everything else

Plasma weapons: really expensive and impractical, reserved only for the rich

Railguns: great with supersoldier units and tanks and often paired with explosives, possible for infantry or civilian self defense but not cheap enough to be practical, also used for lighter AA protection

Flamethrowers: good for close quarters when collateral damage isn't a factor (very rare)

High firerate guns: police and civilian self defense

Anti materiel guns: best choice for infantry cannon fodder and standard androids

Gas weapons: used to drive up the costs of warfare for the enemy rather than as a genuine weapon

Flameblades: tons of mini flamethrowers on a durable blade. Designed for cyborg ninjas as an anti android measure

Counterparts of the military:

Fist of Liberty Branch (direct conventional warfare; encompasses ground forces, navy, AF, space warfare, drones and missiles)

Eye of Liberty Branch (external intelligence, spying, sabotage, assasinations, basically cia)

Mind of Liberty Branch (research, inventions, experiments, bioweapons and secretly nukes)

S2E1 The Train of Destiny

Adrian wakes up in the upper left bunk bed in a high speed train, clackling across the tracks somewhere. He and his group have been provided with a closed room inside the train with 2 double bunk beds and a table in the middle. As he looks outside, he sees beautiful trees of autumny, warm colors, growing beside the tracks. He looks down and sees Kate and Jason sitting on the bottom bed, whispering about something. There's a plastic dish with fried potatoes and synthetic meat, plus a plastic fork. Kate notices Adrian is awake.

"Hey, look who's awake!"

"You slept a whole 2 hours longer than I did! We can finally talk without whispering." - Jason commented.

"Morning, guys." - Adrian said, well rested.

"Come on, come down here. There's a spot on my bed as well as some food with your name on it. " - Vici suggested.

"You know, despite our material value and importance, you shouldn't vandalize government property by writing my name on your blanket with a marker, Vici. Someone sewn that thing, you know. "

"I will do whatever I want, smartass, now come the fuck down or next night you'll be sleeping on the table curled up like a shrimp." - she replied playfully.

"Okay, ma'am, simmer down. I don't want a free ice bracelet." - Adrian replied, smiling, dropped down from his bed to sit near Victoria and began eating.

Kate and Jason looked weird at her.

"Do you guys always interact like that?" - Kate asked after a delay.

"Depends on her mood." - Adrian replied, his mouth full.

"I am capable of playful banter too. Did you really think that just because I don't always talk much I am socially inept?" - Victoria asked.

"Whatever you say, miss Shattering Ice Maraca." - Kate japed.

"Dude, watch out, she's gonna shatter your face with an ice ball for that." - Jason said, causing Kate to laugh and Vici and Adrian to smile.

"You guys have some balls to say things like that to my face after we've been on speaking terms for this little. You're lucky I understand that this is your way of giving me affection." - Victoria replies.

"I still can't believe it's so beautiful on the outside. I've only ever seen this natural beauty from photos, which could be AI generated too for all I know." - Adrian comments.

"If you think about it, what you're seeing outside is actually highly disturbing. These trees are meant to be naked and covered in snow by the time it's the middle of December, but these trees have a warm color of autumn. "

"Well, that's confusing." - Jason notes.

"It's because our planet has been quickly turning into a boiling hellhole for a long time. Think about it, why did we never see a winter and our summers are hellish hot? Climate change. It's partially why we've decided to move to Murmansk, despite a huge chunk of it drowning underwater: there are actually still winters out there."

"That sounds awesome, I wonder how it would feel to build a snowman." - Kate comments.

"Doesn't sound very fun to live in an environment where your balls freeze off once a year, but at least the summers won't burn our skins off, right?" - Jason asks.

"You're right about that. I asked my dad if the government is doing anything about this problem and he told me that they're doing their best without providing me with any details." - Vici notes.

"I bet it was the robots of the Iron Fist fisting the rest of the world with their climate change with their evil technology. I mean, they don't care if they're hotter by a few degrees Celsius, it's us humans who have our skin boil every summer." - Adrian says, agitated.

"They might have, but we don't really know. Don't you guys find it weird that for the last, like, 60 years our Motherland was awesome and perfect and how everyone else was a complete dickhead? It's like the moment when Russia became democratic, everything became awesome and a new golden age started."

"While in reality, modern digital entertainment is such garbage. The games in particular are just complete junk and we have to mainly play games that should have been considered unplayable relics, yet are the best ones we got." - Jason comments.

"You're so right, have you guys played European Escalation II? Where the European Confederation invades the Motherland and you have to defend it?" - Adrian asks.

"I did, I have never played an easier and less balanced strategy game in my life. I don't know if it's AI generated or not, but it's so horrible that it may as well be."

"Or that one cop game where the police are portrayed as morally perfect servants of the law that fight crime, refuse bribes and whenever any cop does anything bad, they're quickly found out and jailed. The cops in Russia used to be corrupt and overall horrible, but now they're holy angels of justice for some reason?" - Victoria said.

"If the military did what they did to us before the Great Fuck You a few days ago, I can't imagine police being any better. "

"The Great Fuck You…" - Kate wheezed and everyone else smiled.

"Yea, it's also a great name. Though, I do prefer the original name: Swords of the Starbloods." - Victoria commented.

As they were troubling, the group did a lot of sleeping, talking, playing, laughing and watching the landscape outside the window. Vici was also making small sculptures out of ice she made from sink water. They weren't amazing, but everyone was impressed with them regardless.

Eventually, they arrived in Moscow to hop on a different high speed train that would take them straight to Murmansk. The children, their parents walked from the previous railway station to the one they needed on the opposite side of the road. Some of them were with suitcases, all of them in light coats and hats except Victoria. They look around and see an unholy amount of cops everywhere, food places packed to the limit with bright, flashy signs, an unholy mountain of billboards seen everywhere, yet at the same time, there's plenty of dirt and garbage everywhere, aswell as homeless men with overgrown facial hair and dirty clothes here and there. The streets are filled with tons of tiny cars with barely enough space for 2 passengers, all with ads on them. The kids all looked disgusted and overwhelmed.

"I refuse to believe this is a real place that exists on the planet Earth. " - Victoria comments, exasperated.

"Dude, it's like a pay to win mobile game, but as a city, and 10 times worse!" - Adrian comments.

"This is overwhelming and I hate it. I really hope it won't take long until we're back on the train." - Kate comments.

"Don't worry, sweetie, it won't take much more." - Kate's mom comforted them.

A random middle aged slightly overweight man in a blue cap with a sign that says, "Vote for Omnislavian Supremacy!" and depicts a proud Omnislavian soldier with an AK-74 and the Omnislavian flag, approaches the group.

"Hey, kids! If your parents vote for Omnislavian Supremacy, they will pay less taxes and there will be more money for them to spend on candy!" - He said cheerfully.

Victoria pulls out an ice maraca from her pocket, turns it into a sharp ice dagger and faces the stranger. "I am going to slit your throat, and then your wrists, then leave you lying on the ground until all your clothes are painted red and stare at you with pleasure as a puddle of blood surrounds your body until you slowly and painfully die from blood loss if you don't fuck off right now."

The stranger was horrified, and the rest of the kids were mildly shocked. "She's right, now fuck off and bother someone else." - Adrian's father said with a mildly threatening voice. The stranger just kept standing in place with an open mouth and not moving, and the group just went past him.

"You weren't actually going to do that to him, were you?" - Kate asks.

"As much joy it would have brought me to do that, I would like my first kill to be someone special. An enemy spy, a dangerous criminal, a drunken hobo who tries to kill me, anyone but a walking ad for a political party."

"I am sure he is just doing his job, just like other adults." - Jason said.

"Jason, look around. Do you really think this world needs any more ads?"

Tense silence. "I don't wanna think about this. Can we all just collectively agree that this city is a fucking nightmare?" - Adrian said with frustration.

"Yep/Absolutely/Let's get the fuck out of here as soon as we can." - Kate, Jason and Victoria all said at the same time.

After getting on a different high speed train to reside in an almost identical room, the group continue to do whatever they can to spend the time. Kate and Victoria are seen hanging out together and doing something while Adrian and Jason chat about something else and have fun.

At some point, Adrian and Jason are seen doing something on their phones in their respective beds and looking mildly bored.

"Man, why can't these phones just connect to the countrywide network?" - Jason asks.

"No idea. I was told something along the lines of the phones being hardcoded to be unable to do that so we're gonna need to make enough money to buy new phones." - Adrian replied.

"That's fucked."

The door opens and Kate and Victoria arrive in the room, then sit down on Vici's bed.

"Guys, guys! We've prepared something cool for you!" - Kate exclaims.

"Oh, is it what you two have been working on lately?" - Adrian asks and gets down on the ground level to sit next to Jason.

"I've been wondering what were the two of you doing all this time. Thought it was going to be some sort of a prank." - Jason commented.

"I am happy none of you caught on. Hit em, Katie." - Victoria said with mild anticipation. Kate began singing, full of emotion:

"Born to fight,

Spread the light,

It's really not that hard, I swear.

The ice shards are flying,

But my soul is dying,

I won't last much longer, I fear.

The adults command me "Destroy",

They tell me the reason when I ask why.

But if all I can do is kill

Where has it gone, my free will?

The world is on fire,

The situation is dire,

And I must save it, I'm afraid.

I charge into battle,

The bones start to rattle,

But my flames still fade away.

Show my might,

Slay the night,

Yet I feel my end is near.

The enemy's falling,

But my agony is growing,

And into the void I stare.

Darkness is rampant, consuming it all,

I train and I fight, or the country will fall.

They don't understand, I'm drowning in pain,

They don't give a fuck that I am going insane.

The people are crying,

Their children are dying,

And I must extinguish the flame.

No matter the season,

I fight for a reason,

Yet my fires die just the same."

Jason watched and listened with an opened mouth as Adrian sat back and just enjoyed the performance. After it was over, Jason started clapping, and Adrian joined him shortly after.

"You girls cooked, holy shit! That was deep!" - he said.

"That was beyond amazing! Wait, Vici, why did you just sit there and smile as Kate was singing?" - Jason commented.

"Dude, the only way it would have been more obvious that Vici was the one who wrote the lyrics would be if they charged us money before singing this to us." - Adrian jabbed. Kate and Jason laughed.

"I need to start charging you for each time you drop one of those." - Victoria replied playfully.

"Not before I start charging you for talking to me every day."

"Too far, Adrian. Try again."

"Sorry. Charge my… balls." - he responded awkwardly.

"Good enough."

"Now I am jealous Vici gets a theme song and none of us don't." - Jason comments.

"To make something like that, you need to have a clear direction in life and something that brings you great pain as inspiration. For example, I want to earn money any way I can, even if I have to kill a lot of people, while at the same time having more skills and passions than just bringing death, and my source of pain was being trapped in the lab with no way out. What's your angle?" - Victoria explains.

"I just wanna socialize and have real friends, not much else. It was so lonely in the big house, and even after I left, I felt like I was completely isolated from everyone other than Lumina, and even she betrayed me and just generally got worse in every way."

"Amen to that." - Adrian noted.

"Well, I doubt we could do a worse job of being friends than her, so, you're in luck!" - Kate commented.

"That's a mood, Jason. Adrian, what about you?" - Vici asked.

"Hm? Oh, I don't know, dude, I just wanna follow you wherever you go and generally have fun in life. My pain? Having a weird power that either makes me too powerful to participate or too weak to do anything, the worst of both worlds."

"I gotta admit, I do wish we could fight together more often. Maybe Murmansk has some way we can improve ourselves in that regard."

"Won't help the fact that what I got isn't much good for a song."

"We're just happy you're here anyway."

"Can I go? Can I go?" - Kate eagerly asked.

"Of course."

"My goal: justice! My pain: injustice!"

"Concise and powerful. Don't see why would you want to make the world a better place when it's clearly irreversibly fucked, but you do you." - Vici commented.

"It's not that fucked. And even if it is, I am ready to do my share of putting evil in its place until the day I die, and maybe one day, we will all live in a gentle world of happiness and joy."

"Cool!" - Adrian exclaims.

Eventually, the group arrives in Murmansk. The city outside the railway station looked like a clean small town environment, with a reasonable amount of commercial establishments. The streets were still filled with tiny electric cars and vans filled with an uncomfortable amount of ads on them, and there's a moderate amount of snow everywhere. It's afternoon outside.

"At least not all cities in Omnislavia are like Moscow." - Adrian says.

"Good pick, Vici." - Kate comments.

"Even the air here feels better." - Vici notices.

The group hops into 2 large parked vans, with the adults going into one of them and the kids going into the other, then they both hit the road.

After a while of traveling in silence, the children inside the van start to look bored. Adrian and Victoria are sitting on one side, holding hands, and Jason and Kate are sitting on the other.

"Can't wait for this to be over already." - Adrian says with audible dread.

"At least we can look outside and watch the buildings… Oh my god, guys, look outside." - Kate notices something.

As everyone looks outside, they see identical 10 story tall buildings standing everywhere, painted ugly orange and shitstain brown. They saw all the windows on upper floors blocked by dark metallic bars and several people on the streets walking somewhere. One woman was walking with giant holes on the right leg of her jeans and the right elbow of her dark green coat.

"I mean, if they only look shitty but are actually fine to live in…" - Victoria thinks aloud.

The van stopped at a red light. "Look at that woman in a thick green shirt, why do her clothes look like a dog tore chunks off them? Is she too poor to afford something in good condition?" - Adrian asks in surprise. Jason and Kate move to the other side to look at the mysterious woman.

"Historically speaking, there's a good chance these people just have a twisted idea of fashion." - Vici suggests.

"Or they're just proud of being poor, for some reason?" - Kate guesses.

"Maybe she's just too hot in these clothes and she made these holes herself so it's not as cold?" - Jason gives his guess.

"Jason, that makes no sense." - Adrian replies.

"I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss that, Adrian. These cities are weird and none of them make any sense. " - Victoria says.

"Still beats our throne of destruction back at the lab, mm?"

She sighs. "Anything would."

Eventually, they all arrive at the target ugly 10 story residential building, into the entrance 6, floor 2. Kate and Victoria (along with Kate's parents) get apartment 207 while Adrian and Jason get apartment 208. After letting go of their suitcases, \*i really cba to write this, the conditions are decent and adrian and jason got separate rooms and it wasn't super different from what they were used to\*

Later, Victoria and Adrian are seen sitting on a bench together in the evening, still holding hands. The sky is empty and white. \*verify realism of white sky\*

"So, we've made it, huh?" - Adrian opens.

"Sure did. Gonna be interesting to see what kind of military school we're going to tomorrow. They might have a different balance of power compared to the lab."

"I am sure the four of us and our super cool superpowers can handle it."

"We're also going to need to find a way to make some money. I have a few ideas."

"Maybe they have some sort of a racket we can take over."

"Dude, what kind of a racket would school children have?"

"I don't know. Beating the shit out of other kids until they give them money?"

"Sounds unlikely, but not impossible."

"I gotta say, I am not used to being in this coat. I feel like a juggernaut, and not in a good way."

"Wish I could share my cold resistance with you. But perhaps with enough money we can get you a better looking coat and hat, at least."

"Maybe. But hey, I am just happy to spend time with you regardless."

"Likewise. I am really afraid of losing you. I feel like I've adapted to living on my own with no problems, but then your warmth started bringing relative happiness to me and I don't know how can I proceed if I lose you."

He puts his hand behind her back. "You keep thinking too much. Your head's too big for your own good. Come on, relax, enjoy the moment and the ugly architecture all around us and the everything else."

"Maybe you're right. I'll try."

S2E2 The Hunter And The Agile Prey

Adrian and Jason leave their apartment with identical backpacks along with Adrian's mom. They meet Kate and Victoria on the doorstep.

"Heyyy, you're here!" - Kate exclaimed.

"A good morning in a new life to you two." - Victoria said with mild happiness.

"Dude, it's like we still live together! This is awesome!" - Adrian exclaimed.

"Hey." - Jason waved to the girls.

"Morning! We and your parents have agreed that I'll show you the way to the school on your first day, after which at least one of you heroes will remember the way." - Adrian's mom says.

"Sweet." - Kate says.

After they left their apartment block, Victoria asks:

"Are we going to be allowed to fight people outside of lessons?"

"Of course, as long as you don't attack anyone more than 1 grade lower than you are."

"Awesome!" - Adrian exclaims.

"This is gonna be exciting! What's a grade, by the way?" - Kate asks.

"Oh, that's which year of school you're currently at. Since you're all now 10 and 11 years old, your grade is the fifth grade, which means everyone is fair game until the next school year."

"Let's try to keep an open mind. Remember, people: we need to know how can we pray on these people's worst instincts for our benefit." - Vici announces.

"Vici!" - Kate exclaims in an offended tone.

"Kate, I don't imagine a military school being a gentle place. It's either them, or us. "

"That's the opposite of keeping an open mind."

"How about this. I know your pneumatic pistol was left behind in the lab. Wouldn't you like a real one?"

"Not gonna lie, I would like a gun. Ideally, I'd like a plasma pistol. It would be so cool to use one."

"Hmm. Excuse me, Adrian's mom, can you look up how much does a basic plasma pistol cost?"

"You didn't ask if we would even buy one for you. " - she replies.

"Alright. Can we?"

"As long as you don't give it to anyone outside the lab and as long as you receive proper training prior to that, yes. Anyway, I know it off the top of my head, it's more or less 750000 bears, not counting the ammo. "

"Ouch. What about a standard ballistic pistol?" - Kate asks.

"Oh, that's only 30000 bears, also not counting the ammo but it's much cheaper."

"Let's make you that 30K, Kate. Come on." - Victoria offers.

"Mmm, gun… Fine, but if we become the boogeymen of the school, I'm out." - she said, savouring the thought of owning a gun.

"Yes! Kate seals your fate!" - Adrian said like he was a narrator for an ad of a superhero movie. The school is seen in the distance, surrounded by a black metallic fence and painted gray and desaturated blue.

As they enter the school itself, they're met with an overweight guard at the desk who is seen playing some sort of an offline shooter. There are several tripod turnstiles in front of them

"Special students coming in for their first day. Are the school passes ready for them?" - Adrian's mom asks.

The guard pauses the game. "Yea, yea, they're ready. Welcome to the school, kids." He hands Adrian's mom the 4 entry passes, who then gives the kids their cards.

"Since you don't have phones yet, you'll need an alternate way to enter the school. These are the school passes. You need them to enter the school. Don't lose them!"

She then demonstrates how to use them using Jason's pass.

"I wonder if we could steal and ransom these passes to other students." - Victoria says.

"Not only getting another one is only a minor inconvenience, most students in the school don't need the passes as they have phones. You're gonna need to find some other way."

"Oh I have a couple of some other ways."

"Please don't tell me you want to make another kissing business again." - Kate says with exasperation.

"Never again in a million years."

Next, Adrian is seen preparing to change his clothes in the men's locker room. Before he can even begin, 2 classmates approach him and begin cracking knuckles.

"Well, well, well, looks like we got ourselves some new blood here!" - one on the left begins. Adrian stops to stare at the welcome wagon.

"We ought to welcome you to the school properly." - the other one says.

Adrian begins projecting into the mind of the right one the following: "Your friend is gonna use this situation to turn on you and beat the shit out of you publicly. Attack him before he attacks you!"

The target becomes visibly confused. "What? You think you're tough because you can ignore us?" - the left one says.

"He's preparing to punch you in the nuts and stomp on your face as you're lying on the ground! Deal the first strike!" - Adrian continues inciting the target. After a delay, he begins punching his teammate and they begin fighting. Half the other boys watch the fight, the other half ignore it completely. Adrian then pulls out his ice sword from his backpack, and when the harassers move far enough away, he stands up and begins viciously swinging at the head of the guy who was formerly on the left a few times until he falls on the ground in pain and begins crying.

"Thanks, dude." - the classmate who Adrian used his telepathy on.

"As thanks you could leave me alone and not ever bother me."

"Why would I want to? You saved me from a beating."

After everyone leaves from the gym after the class is over, the 4 main children congregate in the hallway outside. Victoria is seen without her ice crown again.

"That was so bad. All of it." - Vici comments in a frustrated tone.

"I agree when it comes to the pointless walking around and chanting, but the workout was fun." - Adrian replied.

"Yea, it'll be good for you. You didn't exercise that much in the lab, those classes will help you." - Kate said.

"You're not wrong." - she replies sadly.

"Chanting the national anthem was horrible though. Personally I just- no, I probably shouldn't say it." - Jason said.

"I can guess what you're talking about, I did the same. " - Vici replied, raising her hands.

"What are they talking about?" - Kate said, facing Adrian.

"I'll tell you later." - Victoria promised.

Victoria is then seen standing in a hallway against a wall during a break from classes, eavesdropping on a group of boys around her age nearby while doing her best to act inconspicuous. Her crown is back on her head.

"...and then I told them: hey! Why won't you get back in the kitchen and cook me some chicken nuggets with garlic sauce inside? And then they tried to say something and I kicked them both in the nuts and they ran away screaming!" - one of them said.

"Did you make that up on your own? People fall down on the ground if you kick them in the nuts, not run away."

"These girls did!"

"It's okay, Victoria, you just have to endure their stupidity, it won't take long." - Vici thought.

"Hey, have you guys heard about Croccoflop beating Element Eliminators without any microtransactions?"

"Bullshit!"

"Well he did, took like 6 weeks and several hundred hours."

"I wonder if he can do that with Age of Shadow 4."

"Nope, no way."

"Well, knowing him-"

At that moment Victoria noticed 3 teenagers, 2 boys and a girl, approaching her and one of them in particular getting too close. She quickly pulled out 2 ice maracas out of her and faced the strangers.

"Got a deathwish, dickfaces?"

The teens looked at eachother and laughed condescendingly. "The rich girl thinks she's hot shit!" - the left boy said.

"It's in your best interest to hand us over that crystal crown of yours if you want to avoid a beating. I am sure your daddy can buy you a new one with no problems." - the girl said in a gentle tone.

"Oh please, no, not the crown. I can give you guys something else which is equally as valuable instead. Can one of you step forward and give me their hand?" - she said with a sarcastically miserable tone.

The bully girl stepped forward and gave Victoria her left hand, keeping her right one in a fist. In turn, Vici quickly turned her ice maracas into a very tall ice armband around the bully girl's left arm, then took advantage of her staggering from pain to grab her by the neck with both of her hands. The other 2 boys stepped back in terror.

"Argh, holy shit, holy shit!"

"Listen here, shit-for-brains. You've just tried to mug the new apex predator of the school, so now, I am mugging you. Give me everything you have."

"Do something, boys! Get her off me!"

She grabbed the bully by her right hand and turned her around. "It's not gonna work. I've just given you an ice band of death. The only one who can remove it without tools too advanced for school is myself, and if I don't remove it soon, you will lose this arm to frostbite. I want all of you to give me all the money you have or she gets another one of those."

"Miss me with this shit!" - one of the male bullies runs away. The other one silently gives Victoria 500 bears in cash, which she accepts and puts in her pockets. The teen girl gives her another 200 from her pockets, which Vici likewise stores in hers. She then proceeds to search the bully girl's pockets for more stuff.

"Maybe I can find something good in your pockets. A keychain, useless. A hair comb, useless. Sweet wireless headphones, mine now. Oh, that's a nice looking phone." She drops the things she doesn't wanna take on the ground and puts in her pockets the things she wants to take.

"Please… Not the phone!"

"Oh don't worry about the phone. Bring me 1500 bears next school break right here or I will flush it down the toilet."

"That's almost the price of the entire phone! Please, have mercy!"

"At least you'll know not to fuck with me. Attack me after I remove the ice from your arm and I'll flush the phone anyway." She turns the ice armband back into ice maracas, after which the remaining bullies pick up their stuff on the ground and quickly walk away. Victoria then looks at the 3 dudes she was supposed to be eavesdropping on. They're staring at her in awe.

"Is there a problem?" - she asks them.

"How the fuck did you just defend yourself against 3 teenagers?"

"I have my ways. Carry on with your business. Unless you have someone who needs to be taught a lesson."

"Hey, my sister's ex bullies her from time to time and everyone refuses money for fighting him! Can you do your magic on him?"

"If you give me enough money, yea."

Meanwhile, Adrian is seen walking down the hallway. Victoria walks at him.

"Dude, Vici, we've got progress!"

She takes his hands into hers. "I was about to tell you the same thing."

"You go first."

"3 teens tried to bully me, and then kindly donated 700 bears and some wireless headphones to me. Can you also hold onto those?" - she hands Adrian over the stolen phone.

"Whoa, and you're giving it to me?"

"I would, but I don't want the cunt that gifted it to me to have a vendetta against me and turn into Lumina. I'll ransom it back to her for 1500 bears. "

"Spoils of war, mm? I don't know how much we need for a phone but it shouldn't take long at this rate."

"I also got a contract from fourth graders to beat the shit out of a specific 13 year old for 500 bears. Easy stuff, as long as they don't try to run when I demand payment."

"Nice! I found out that you can apparently buy \*spice\*, whatever that is, and it's allegedly not expensive."

"That's awesome. We could easily extort them for a large cut of the profits."

After the next school break, Victoria stands against a wall and begins eavesdropping on 2 girls, also around her age. One of them appears Mexican.

"I wonder if we could lure that grivus into a quiet place somewhere and cut out her bionic eye so we can sell it and buy ourselves a Loonty Portable."

"Can you speak a little louder so the girl with the crystal crown reports us to the principal!? Holy shit, Fernanda."

Victoria pretended to only now notice the conversation and turned her head towards the girls. "Were you talking to me?"

"No, it's just…" - the Mexican girl said.

"Don't bullshit us, girl, you heard the whole thing. If you report us to the principal, we'll curb stomp you to the grave." - the other one replied.

She walks closer to them and starts talking quieter. "Why would I report you to the principal? Listen. I am broke as hell, and I'm an expert in extortion, intimidation and combat, and on top of that, I can create an ice scalpel to do the job properly with less traces." She demonstrates her skills by creating a surgical knife out of ice and disassembling it shortly after back into ice. "Now, who's the girl with the bionic eye?"

The other girls looked at eachother in uncertainty. "Are you some sort of grivus too?" - Fernanda asked.

"I have no idea what that word means."

"She probably isn't. Here's my question: why do you claim to be broke when you have a crystal crown on your head like you're some sort of an oligarch princess?" - the non-Mexican girl asks.

"It's a very long story which I could tell you if we work together on this. Before you ask, no, I am not selling it, and no, you can't have it."

"What do we do, Linda?" - Fernanda asks.

"At this point there's not a lot more to explain, she knows everything. You know Yulia, right?"

"It's my first day in school. I don't." - Vici replies.

"It's the girl with the hair which changes color. You saw her at the gym, she sticks out like a sore thumb. She has a bionic eye, bionic hair and for all we know probably more. She is an entitled bitch who thinks she owns the world and we all hate her." - Linda replies.

"Does she ever walk alone?"

"No, sometimes her boyfriend is around. What's your name, by the way?"

"Victoria. This might be complicated. We'd have to distract him somehow, then analyze her pathing of how she gets home, choose an ambush spot and execute the plan. You two would need to find information online for how to do it properly, since I don't have a phone."

The girls' eyes widened. "Señorita, why do you have the principal behind you, staring at you like you've just insulted the Motherland?"

Victoria turned around. There was, indeed, an adult woman staring at Victoria, with the teenage girl Victoria stole the phone from an hour ago. The principal was dressed in a blue dress, with a shiny badge on her chest. She had white hair of medium length. "Did you steal her phone, Victoria?"

Victoria faked confusion. "What are you talking about?"

"Of course she is denying it! My boyfriend told you, he saw it with his own eyes! " - the teen girl said with anger and desperation.

"Into the principal's office with me, now!" - the principal ordered Victoria.

"I'll see you girls around. Seems like someone's trying to frame me." She showed her new cooperators a hand of goodbye.

Right before entering the principal's office, Victoria put the stolen wireless headphones into her boot. When they got in, it was an elegant place made almost entirely of beautiful brown wood. The principal sat at her desk, and the 2 girls sat across eachother on chairs.

"So, why did I suddenly steal a phone on my first day of school despite being perfectly able to buy one without problems?" - Victoria said.

"You tell me! You attacked me and Mike, then took our money and my phone!" - the victim girl said angrily.

"Calm down, Masha. Victoria, did you steal her phone?" - the principal asked.

"I have no idea what she's talking about. I am just a girl who wants to see what the school is like before actually choosing what I do in my freetime."

Struggling to contain anger, the teen girl took a deep breath and said, "She is obviously lying. She took the phone from me, as clear as day."

"Jesus christ… Let's try to call your phone from mine, and if we hear the ringtone from the room, it means she did steal it from you. Give me your phone number." - the principal said with mild dread in her voice. Masha gave the principal her phone number which the principal dialed on her phone and called her. Victoria stayed silent.

Adrian was shown to be talking to someone and startled when the stolen phone rang. He then pulled it out, rejected the call, turned the phone off and put it back into his pocket.

Back in the principal's office, everyone saw the phone screen. "The phone call was rejected. She doesn't have your phone. Why are you accusing this random student you don't even know of stealing your phone? What scheme are you trying to pull on me this time?" - the principal asked.

Victoria stands up and tries to put her hand on Masha's shoulder, but she pushes her away. "Sweetie, assuming you actually did have your phone stolen, I am really, really sorry you got into this situation. If I could, I would help you find your phone, but we don't have anything to go off of to help you. You might have to take the L on this one."

"Take the L? My grandparents used to say that." - the principal said.

Masha starts crying. "Please! There has to be security camera footage or something!"

"Ever since our school got defunded, we had to sell most of our security cameras, and those that weren't don't cover that area. And even if that wasn't the case, I wouldn't even bother looking at it, because you are a vicious, manipulative whore and for some reason you've decided to frame up this innocent, empathetic, sweet girl who just arrived in school because you thought she was gonna be an easy mark." Victoria covered her mouth so the principal wouldn't see her struggling to contain a smile over the ridiculously incorrect assessment of herself. "I will notify your parents about this, another one of those and I won't suffer your bullshit any longer. Both of you, get out of my office."

The girls left the office. "It would be 2000 bears now. Chop chop." - Victoria told her victim as she was walking away in tears before going the other way. "You brought this on yourself, idiot. Besides, a predator has got to eat." - she thought to herself.

Victoria is later seen casually approaching 2 13 year old boys talking to eachother, one of them being Mexican. She comes to the other boy and throws 2 shattering ice maracas into his face, causing him to fall down on the ground, cover his face with hands and start crying. The other boy ran away in terror. She then grabbed the target's neck with her ice hands.

"Stay away from Arina or next time, it will hurt a hell of a lot more."

"Oh my god, okay…"

She let him go and walked away.

Later, she is seen standing beside the door to the 5A dressing room, talking to the boy who recruited her earlier along with his friend.

"It's done? So he won't bother me again anymore?"

"It would be suicidal. And even if he does continue, you can just pay me again, he will go through more pain than KGB has ever inflicted upon anyone. I mean, Satan himself will pledge his soul to me so he can get on my level. He wouldn't be able to attack your sister since he wouldn't have any arms to hit her with."

"Wow! Thank you so much, I don't know how many more beatings she could have taken before getting a broken bone or something. Here's the dollars with an extra tip on top, plus 27 XP." He hands her over bills worth 500 and 100 bears.

"Keep the XP, I am max level. Pleasure doing business with you."

She then headed to the 5C dressing room to wait for her friends to finish putting on their coats. "Hmph. Max level. Sure hope not." - she thought to herself.

As she walked close, she found Masha standing near the entrance, with a devastated look on her face.

"I have the money. Give me my phone, if you still have it. I give up."

"So you did come around. I have it. Can I see the money?"

She complies and shows a lot of banknotes.

"Who do you think you're playing? This is 1900. I asked for 2000." Several people are seen leaving the dressing room.

"It's all here." - Masha replied calmly.

"500+2\*200+10\*100, that's 1900. Is this a joke to you? Are you really that eager for me to flush your phone down the toilet?"

"I am sorry! Here's another hundred." She adds another 100 bear banknote.

"Oh no no no, you've just tried to scam me out of 100 bears, so I am gonna take an extra hundred from you so you finally learn the lesson."

"Okay, I am sorry!" She adds yet another one.

As Victoria receives the money, Adrian is seen leaving the dressing room in his coat. "No, Adrian, get back in there for a moment, you little shit."

"Ma'am, yes, ma'am!" - he answers.

"Fuck you too, Adrian. I'll be right back with the phone."

Vici enters the dressing room, and comes out of it shortly after with the stolen phone, then hands it over to Masha.

"It wasn't so hard, wasn't it?" She cracks a fake smile to further disturb the teen girl.

"What about the headphones?"

"That's sold separately. I am thinking 300- no, 500 bears for the headphones."

"That's just cruel." She removes the phone case from her phone and pulls out a 500 bear bill from there, with a few more lying there, then puts the phone back inside.

"At least that'll teach you how to analyze your marks better before going in for the kill. Oh damn it, I could have made twice as much if i searched the phone case. I guess as a gesture of my goodwill, you can keep these."

"You're despicable."

Victoria receives the 500 bear bill and gives Masha the stolen headphones. "Don't pretend you have a moral high ground over me. You hustle, I hustle. You rob, I rob. Not my fault you have a skill issue. Happy hunting." She waved goodbye to her victim and walked back into the dressing room.

Next, the 4 main children are seen walking in the school courtyard after leaving the school itself.

"Any success, guys?" - Vici asks.

"I beat the shit out of 3 random bullies all over the school. One of them was too strong for me, but it's still a good result." - Kate explained.

"Let's go Kate!" - Adrian exclaimed, and no, a lack of a comma there is intentional.

"I was just trying to get to know my class better. They're not very open to friendship." - Jason commented.

"I got to know the criminal underworld of the school today and made 200 bears by causing a distraction!" - Adrian said enthusiastically.

"Nice job. I've received… 3900 bears. You guys can guess how." - Victoria said.

"Why am I not even surprised?" - Jason commented.

"Did you rob the cafeteria?" - Kate asked, unphased.

"Too high profile. And there's plenty of other reasons for why that'd be unwinnable." - Vici replied.

Suddenly, 6 teens entered the courtyard from outside and blocked the exit, 4 of them being Mexicans. The main 4 draw their weapons.

"You've caused enough trouble for one day, Victoria. We won't stand for this." - one of them says.

"If you're so eager to jump into the meat grinder, that's fine by me. We'll destroy all of you so hard that you'll wish the Iron Fist exterminated your entire ethnos." - Victoria replies.

The rest of her squad aswell as her opponents become visibly shocked. "Vici, what the fuck!?" - Kate asked in anger.

"Isn't that like telling jews that they'll wish the H bro finished them all off?" - Adrian asked.

"No, you guys are right, I'm sorry. Too far. I am still gonna bathe you in pain."

The teens charge at the 4 main children. Adrian and Jason run to the right side, with Jason lifting one of the teens up into the air and Adrian telepathically whispering to another one:

"I AM VICTORIA AND I WILL DETONATE YOUR BRAIN IF YOU DON'T ATTACK YOUR FRIENDS RIGHT NOW! DO IT, PUSSY!"

The psionic attack made the target teen run away in fear instead. Adrian tried it on another one, and he actually complied and switched to attack his allies.

At the same time, Victoria told Kate and ran left:

"Keep your distance, I have a plan."

Despite Victoria succeeding in making distance from Kate, the 3 teens that went after the left side of the battlefield all charged Victoria instead and ignored Kate entirely. In preparation to face 3 teens all by herself, she prepared a triple ice maraca in each of her hands, and when the attackers got close, she launched them both as shattering ice maracas, knocking down the middle one and inflicting heavy stagger on the other two. Kate sprinted to the closest one to her who was still standing and started viciously beating him, and Victoria finished off both other attackers before they could do anything significant. By this time, the teen who Adrian coerced into joining his side was sprinting towards the trio which focused on Victoria, but after they all fell on the ground, some of them groaning in pain, he abruptly stopped and raised his hands up. "Please don't detonate my brain."

"Uhh, yes, stay frosty and I won't." - she replied.

Adrian and Jason came closer to the girls, Jason still levitating a teen in the air. "This is kinda groovy, actually." - the flying teen comments.

"Who sent you lot?" - Kate started questioning.

"The boss. Daniel Esqueda." - the teen coerced by Adrian replied.

"Why would you say that so soon? I am joking, these grivuses would have beaten it out of us anyway." - the flying teen replied blissfully.

"Anything else we should ask them, boss lady?" - Kate asked.

"Suck my ass, Kate. But no. Let's loot them and get out of here." - Vici replied.

"Oh holy shit, it's him! He's coming for you!" - the flying teen said, alarmed.

The gang turned around and saw an oversized black teen while still watching out for the previous attack force attacking someone while they're all distracted. He was in a coat, but it was obvious that he had one hell of a body. He wielded a baseball bat with his two hands and was menacingly approaching the battlefield. All the 4 main children were in awe.

"Since when does Omnislavia have black people?" - Adrian asked.

"I've never heard of any from here either. They must be pretty rare." - Kate replied.

"If you've got something to say, why won't you say it to my baseball bat?" - the stranger replied.

"Look, it's really interesting to see an actual black human being in person. However, I am still destroying you, and to show you how wrong you are for having picked this side, I will strike you down alone while my friends loot the other teens. Give me your best, tough guy." - Victoria said, preparing ice maracas for combat.

"You won't stand a chance against her, shadow person!" - Adrian exclaims.

"Careful there. That's a little borderline"

"Sorry."

Victoria runs at the adversary and throws 4 shattering ice maracas at him. He partially blocks the ice shards with his bat and dashes at Victoria. When he gets close, he takes a swing at Victoria with his bat. She blocks the strike with a double ice shield, then wraps the ice shield around the bat and tries to yank it from her foe's hands. Her strength fails, and she decides to backstep as he is trying to kick her with his legs.

"Well I am not doing that again."

The attacker dashes forward to try to kick Victoria again. She sidesteps the attack and throws 2 shattering ice maracas into his face. The teen drops the bat and grabs Vici by the neck with the right hand to try to choke her, which she counters by shoving ice into his clothes, on his arm. It causes him to lose the grip and stagger, which Victoria capitalizes on by throwing 2 more pairs of shattering ice maracas into the foe's face, bringing him on the ground.

"Impossible… What grivus shit is this?" - he asks.

"That word again, the does it mean?"

"People with cybernetics. You must have the top notch stuff fresh off the factory to be able to do all that."

"I have no idea why I have these powers, my parents never explained to me. It could be cybernetics, it could be bioengineering, could be both. I assume \*the boss\* sent you, so tell him this: tomorrow we will have a little chat with him and he better be prepared to donate us a mountain of money if he wants to get out of it unscathed."

"I hate that guy. I actually wanted to kick your ass so I could steal your money. So I could buy my brother a new console."

"Don't we all. Now give me all your money or I'll physically freeze your balls off."

The 4 children are later seen approaching their home apartment block.

"I am thinking the most optimal way for us to spend our money is to buy ourselves one phone, and then get crayons and paper to make advertisements for our ass kicking company. And when we get to school, we'll also milk the cash cows which are the so-called boss and the cybernetic hair girl, whatever her name is. Yulia. That way, we should have all we ever want in no time." - Victoria explains.

"Sick! We'll go to that theme park together and it will be amazing!" - Adrian said with happiness and hope.

"Careful not to lose yourself in the grind too much, Vici. You're efficient, just don't let it be your downfall." - Kate commented.

"I know how to control myself. Don't you worry. We don't even need that much money, anyway."

S2E3 Innocent Tomfoolery

Adrian and Victoria were sitting on a bench in the playground near their apartment block, embracing eachother and watching something on their new phone.

"Hey guys, welcome to Clash of Cash! Today, we will be taking 6 political prisoners from the Tver High Security prison. They will all be divided into 2 teams, and each team would have to bite off at least one pube from all 3 of the opponents' penises first to proceed to the next round! The pubes of all the contestants were painted different colors to distinguish pubes of different people, and the contestants had their arms handcuffed behind their backs!" - the phone speaker was saying before Vici paused the video. Midway through, she and Adrian started laughing.

"What kind of parallel universe is this? Why pubes specifically?" - Adrian asked, still laughing.

"That's a hilarious idea, to be fair, but don't you see what this guy is doing beyond the weird ideas? I mean, let's take a look at his other videos. "I made 8 death row prisoners fight to the death to save their lives". "If he can survive in a dark hangar of nightmares for a month, he gets 1000000 bears". "Which one of these ladies can please my staff the best?"- Okay, that one sounds disgusting out of context. Aside from that, he's exploiting poor people for content and fame, and it's working. Isn't this awesome?"

"You're right, didn't ancient Romans have that with the Colosseum and shit?"

"They did. Except at some point we decided we're too 'sophisticated' for that. Can't duel this, can't snort cocaine that, but I guess not all hope is lost yet. Unless this is staged, hold on…" She takes control over the phone and begins searching up Clash of Cash.

"Whoa, those are some nasty allegations. Fraud, coercion, abusing a pyramid scheme? Can these allegations be fake aswell?" - Adrian made an emphasis of confusion on

"Noone would want to have such serious allegations against them. Guy's definitely real."

"I still can't get over that random headline I saw in the news. 'New Trend To Give Free Money To Police Officers', like, huh? Why cops specifically?"

"I am not buying it. Almost certainly it's the government meddling with the mass media. That, or everyone around us is insane."

"They probably are, but you know what? I couldn't have felt more secure exploring and learning about this new world with you by my side. This whole adventure of ours has so far been nothing but raw, unfiltered fun for me."

"Same for me. I can't believe I managed to find someone who cares about me and hangs out with me, and not for an ulterior motive."

"Damn, you got me. I do have an urterior motive to be around you as much as possible. Busted."

"I don't think you did a very good job at guessing what that word means."

"Well, I am sorry, okay? I am just not as perfect as you are."

"Can it already." - Victoria puts down the phone on the bench and gives Adrian's cheek a good pinch.

Adrian smiles. "Aw! Rude! We're not even a week into this and we're already at the point where we have domestic violence."

Vici giggles and starts repeatedly pinching Adrian's face and arms with both of her hands, leading Adrian to move away from her and try to cover his face to protect himself. "Oh god! Stop it! That's too much pinching!"

"I am gonna domestic violence you to death for patronizing me, come here."

"Nooooooo! Have mercy!"

In the morning of the following day, as Victoria and friends were walking towards the school, Adrian stopped and said:

"Wait. I sense weird psychic energy readings around us. It's like… A baby crawling on the ground somewhere behind us."

Everyone turned around and saw a small tabby cat to the side of the path the children were taking.

"Aww, what an adorable mini tiger!" - Kate said.

"That looks like a cat. Vici, do you know if it's safe to pet one?" - Adrian asked.

"If I had to guess, yea, as long as you respect it and its wishes."

"Oh! Let me try." He approached the cat as his friends watched them with curiosity and adoration. He gave it a few pets from the top of its head to its tail, which the cat completely ignored and ventured further.

"That was the last thing I expected to happen." - Jason commented.

"Damn it, looks like I forgot to turn off my psychic ghost form." - Adrian said.

"We can't really expect anything from these beings. It appears they have a free will, just like ourselves. Maybe if we treat them with kindness, they'll repay it with affection." - Vici commented. She looked visibly pleased with the encounter.

As they were all entering the school courtyard, she pulled out a poster from her backpack and taped it on the unguarded gate leading to the school courtyard. The poster had the following printed on it:

"Have someone who fucked you over? Let us teach them a lesson!

We have:

- 100% success rate
- 500 OSB (omnislavian bear) per target for a standard incapacitation
- 1000 OSB to incapacitate and torture a target ensuring they won't ever mess with you again
- Several methods of torture available
- Seriously, if you have the money, they will never mess with you again

To book a service, go to Victoria or Adrian from class 5C or send a message to our official e-mail: <assaultandbatteryforhire@mail.om>"

"We'll put some more posters everywhere, but other than that I think we're just gonna do our own thing since it looks like you two got this." - Kate said.

"Feel free to ask us for help if you need any!" - Jason noted.

"Thank you, gentlemen. Won't be long before we start raking major cash and be able to afford anything we want." - Vici said.

The first couple school breaks were spent by Adrian and Victoria accepting contracts with upfront payment. A small line was formed for requesting said contracts, with Victoria discussing the details and Adrian noting everything down on a to-do list with his pen.

"Daniel Esqueda? We can't do it for… reasons we can't disclose. However, we can threaten to beat the shit out of him unless he returns your box of pens, and if he doesn't comply, we actually will. The price shall remain the same. Does that work?" - Victoria asks a contractor who looks to be around her age.

"Yes, thank you! I'll take it if it's the best I can get." - the contractor replied, gave Victoria 5 100 bear bills and joyfully jumped away.

The next one in line approached the duo and began:

"Hey, I want Martin Zhukovsky from 7A tortured and beaten the shit out of and be told to stay away from Uliana."

"It's you! Why won't you quit it? She won't suck you off and she hates your guts!" - the dude right behind yelled.

"You will fuck off from her or I will pay Victoria a thousand a day to grant you a daily dose of agony!" - the one in front turned around to face his nemesis.

"I will pay two thousand a day to make you suffer every day twice!" The rivals break out into a fight. Adrian rolls his eyes.

"Calm down, you two. Just pay me a thousand each right now and both of you will be on the hit list." - Victoria suggested.

When the next school break began, the duo approached a seemingly random Mexican teenage boy who was spinning a triangle ruler around his left index finger. Adrian grabbed him by the throat and pointed his ice sword into his face, while Victoria grabbed his right hand with both of her freezing hands.

"Ay dios mio, what did I do?"

"The better question is what are you going to do. And the answer is that you'll tell us where to find Esqueda." - Victoria asked.

"Wait, the kingpin or the prince?"

"There's 2 of them?" - Adrian said.

"Whichever one is calling the shots. That's Daniel, right?" - Vici answered, pronouncing Daniel the English way.

"He's probably on the couches near the exit, along with his friends. Can't miss him, he has a skull tattoo on the right side of his neck. I don't know, I don't work for him anymore."

"Let him go, Adrian. Let's move." The duo let the teen go.

"I hope you give him a nice knuckle sandwich for withholding my payments and not respecting my free time!"

"Sorry to hear that, man!" - Adrian replied.

After arriving at the couches on the bottom floor, Adrian and Vici with ice maracas in both hands managed to locate the big boss. He was an extra tall Mexican teenager, with his teen buddies sharing the couch with him. The skull tattoo on his neck was extremely detailed. The skull itself had extra eyes and teeth on it and was wearing a highly decorated gold crown. He was wearing a white shirt and jeans.

"Good morning, gentlemen! I hope the school is treating you well. How can I help you?" - he opened welcomingly.

"That friendly attitude can't save you from what's coming. You two, off the couch." - Victoria ordered his friends.

"Who do you think you are?" - the one on the left asked, before Victoria threw one shattering ice maraca into his face and Daniel slapped his cheek, both at the same time.

"What he meant to say is, he will now vacate his place to allow you two to sit down so we can begin." - he said.

"Do we, like, squat near you guys?" - the other friend asked.

"If he trusts you two with business matters, sure."

They complied and squatted on the floor. Victoria sat to the side of the boss, and pushed him to the side to allow herself to sit between Adrian and Daniel. Vici took hold of Daniel's arm with her icy hand power partially activated to apply extra pressure.

"First of all, I'd like to apologize to you for asking my boys to give you a warm welcome into the school. I admit, that was stupid of me, I won't do it again and I hope that despite that incident we can still work together. And here's 2000 bears, all producing a roar of apology on my behalf." He pulls out a 2000 bear bill with his free hand and hands it to Victoria, who promptly accepts it.

"Sweet. I trust you know what happens when you decide to poke the bear again. That also applies to my friends, including Adrian, Jason and Kate from my class."

"Got it, it's okay, we're all friends now. Is this two sided?"

"What?"

"I am just worried that some of my guys will be targeted by your services, you know. 500 bears isn't a lot when you can spend them to beat up whoever you want."

"I see. You're correct in expecting that, however, I do need to maintain my professional integrity as nobody likes paying a two-faced backstabbing bitch. But I can offer you and any 3 people you pick an option to not get attacked on the condition you fulfill the demand of the contractor."

"Thank you, friend. What if they demand one of us to sell our house and donate us all the revenue or something?"

Silence. "I know that might not be very good for professional integrity, but we could make a secret service to cancel a different contractor's hit for an equivalent fee." - Adrian suggested.

"Yea… It has to be expensive though, or people will just abuse it to gain immunity. I am thinking to make it cost double the target contract's fee, plus provide the target a full refund to minimize reputation loss. It's not perfect but until we get any better ideas it will have to do."

"Alright, we can take that. I'd like these two, Yaroslav and Thomas from my class to have that partial immunity, and my girlfriend Vera."

"Wait, Thomas Domodedov?"

"That's me." - one of Daniel's buddies replied.

"Adrian, what do your notes say about him?"

"Let me check… You should apologize to Jane for sending her a dick pic." - he reads.

"Oh, that was you. Fucking gross, dude. You better be on your knees in front of her or our little invincibility pact won't save you from an array of frostbite scars." - Vici tells Thomas with disgust.

"Will do."

"Let's get back to the task at hand. We know you host illegal markets for drugs. What are you selling?"

"Meth, spice, ritalin. We're open to any suppliers we can find. Do you know any?"

"No. We're children of the military, we don't know much. About the criminal underworld that is."

Daniel's eyes widened. "Oh please don't report us! We can't go to juvie, we have families! Brothers and sisters and everything!"

"Nobody is going to juvie. Assuming a 25% cut of all the profits goes into our pockets, that is."

"That's a lot, but sure! Noone has to know."

"How much do you make doing this, anyway?"

"Around 2-4K a week."

"Chump change. I shall be expecting my cut today or tomorrow, and if I find out that you're cheating me out of my money, I will butcher you like a pig. I hope that's clear."

"All clear, ma'am. You know, you guys could help out our business in more ways than one. It's not easy to find trustworthy help."

"Our hands are tied, but I'll let Jason know you asked. I can imagine you'll get along more than fine. Anything else we need to know?"

"Nope, we went over everything."

"Good. Before we go, I suggest you return Artyom from 5B his, what was it, box of pens. You know what happens if you won't." The duo stand up and begin walking away.

"Shit, alright. I liked it."

When the duo leave the big boss's vicinity, his buddies rejoin him at the couch. Yaroslav asks him:

"This is humiliating. How could they do this to us?"

"It is, but there's nothing we can do right now. Their grivus tech is simply too much for us to handle. We'll just have to wait for them to drop an opening for us to do something about them, or somehow make us reap more benefits from them than they reap from us. "

Adrian and Victoria are seen approaching and incapacitating several students. Eventually, they approach her first contractor talking with a friend again.

"Hey guys, what's- OH MY GOD, AHHH!" - Victoria puts ice bracelets on the target. Adrian assisted by beating him with his ice sword in the shoulders. His friend ran away.

"Please, stop this! I thought we were friends!" - the target said, almost crying.

She doesn't attack further. Adrian also stops after noticing. "Someone paid to give you revenge for what you paid me to do to him. Nothing personal. I can refund it for 2000 bears." - Victoria offered.

"2000? I don't have that much, but I can give you 1000 to do the same thing to whoever ordered this on me!"

"That works. Adrian, add that to our to-do list."

"Shucks, I needed that money." The target hands Vici over two 500 bear bills, which she stores in her pockets. As Adrian pulls out the sheet with the contracts and adds a new one in there, Victoria continues putting more ice on the target, then begins putting her freezing hands on the target's neck as he groans in pain.

After a while of this, she collects her ice from the victim, transforms it back into ice maracas and stashes them back into her pockets. "Pleasure doing business with you." - she says before walking away with Adrian.

"I kinda feel bad. It's like he trusted us, and we sold him out for 30 silver or whatever, you get the reference." - Adrian commented with regret.

"I mean, we're not hypocrites. If anything, we're less hypocrites than we would have been if being a contractor gave you immunity to being a target: as long as we get the money, we guarantee success or a refund."

"I guess so. I suppose the whole point of this \*is\* to get a lot of money, and we're raking it so far." While Victoria's mental gymnastics did help Adrian make peace with what they were doing, he still felt somewhat guilty over it.

"Yea. Remember, we're the only ones who matter. We're the main characters. Everyone outside our inner circle is a tool to be used for us to move up in the world, until we become emperor and empress of the Earth, at which point we will colonize space and invent games to play with our subjects and generally do whatever we want."

"Yea, you're so right. Maybe we can make actually amazing modern games then and make in-app purchases in pay-to-win games universally cost nothing." - Adrian's tone changed from sadness to hope.

"Amen to that idea."

Next, the duo is seen in the principal's office.

"I understand your desire to make a business in this world, and that's perfectly fine with me. But why are these posters EVERYWHERE? What you're doing is bordering on vandalism and you have to stop." - she explained while pointing at one of the posters to express her point.

"Well we needed to advertise it somehow. We don't really have phones, so we can't exactly do it in the school group chat, assuming there is one." - Vici responded in a naive tone with an innocent looking smile.

"There isn't one."

"See? It's not like it's that bad. Just hustlas innocently hustling, nomsayin?"

"Victoria, we found 21 posters all over the school and counting. Twenty. Fucking. One. And counting. You can't just use an excuse of 'oh it was just a bit of innocent tomfoolery' after you cover half of Murmansk in aluminum foil."

"I mean, have you been to Moscow? This really isn't so bad." - Adrian caught onto what Vici was doing and added his fair share into the conversation.

"He's right." - Vici affirmed.

"Oh don't give me those innocent eyes. I know what you are. I am not trusting you again." Victoria was alarmed for a moment, but then realized what the principal meant and calmed down. "We're gonna have a serious talk with your parents if you put any more. Dismissed."

As the duo left, Adrian exclaimed:

"Motherfuck!"

"It's not a huge setback, our infamy should give us some time to make up a way to circumvent that order. Maybe making merch with these shirts and giving the shirts away to really poor people who can't afford a lot of clothes or something: that should achieve the same effect, plus give a nice virtue signaling bonus."

"A corporation that professionally beats the shit out of people being famous for caring about the working class. Now that's an image we'd love to have."

As the main four were leaving school, Kate asked:

"Did you two make us rich today?"

"Sure did. We definitely should have enough for 3 more phones now. Shame Mr. Boss Man was quite stingy when it came to announcing the income he was willing to share with us, I am gonna have to figure out a way to discover any money he's hiding somehow." - Victoria answered in a frustrated tone.

"I mean, why would he hide it from us? He knows what you're capable of. What we're capable of. It would be suicide to try to cheat us." - Adrian commented.

"You don't understand. It's unreasonable to assume his kind aren't sly crooks who don't try to cheat you on every step. He is absolutely plotting something behind our backs: it's not a question of 'does he', it's the question of 'when and what'."

"That's 2 questions."

Vici pinches Adrian's cheek again. "Smartass."

"What about the rich girl? Any success on that front?" - Jason asked.

Adrian put a hand on his mouth in surprise and Victoria made an awkward expression. Everyone stopped. "Oh god damn it." - she replied.

"How did we forget to do half the job? I thought we were smarter than this." - Adrian comments.

"We haven't forgotten about her until we have confirmation she's out of our reach. Let's check if she's still inside."

"You two are on your own, because I've had enough of that school for the day." - Kate said.

"Not a problem, this will go smoother if we do it on our own. Can you guys buy a phone each for yourselves and one extra for Adrian?" Victoria pulled out all of her money and gave it all to Jason.

"This is amazing. So much cash."

"It's nice of you to prioritize our happiness over maximizing your ability to get more money. Thank you." - Kate comments.

"You're welcome, but also access to Cheburnet and being able to contact one another at any point in time will be essential for our success. We can't afford everything we need yet. "

"What she means to say is, you guys matter and you deserve to be happy." - Adrian comments. Vici pinches his cheek again. "Abuse!"

Kate smiles. "What an adorable pair of devils in human clothing."

A few minutes later, Adrian and Victoria are seen sitting on a bench across their class's dressing room, waiting for the target to leave.

"I honestly have no idea how would we pitch our services to her without being annoying. I've never done this sort of thing before." - Vici admitted.

"Oh, we got this. We just need to figure out what she wants to hear and say these things."

"I mean, obviously, but it's good that you're learning. Might have an idea what to open with, just try to go along and do your best to make her feel comfortable with us."

"We can do this. Oh, there she is." They saw Yulia leaving the dressing room, hastily stood up and started following her outside.

"Hey, Yulia! I hope we're not interrupting you. We heard you have some problems with your classmates and we'd like to help you with them. How does that sound?" - Vici opened in a kind voice.

"Did they put you up to prank me? Go away."

"We weren't put up by anyone, we just want to help you. We're friends. We like helping." - Adrian added.

"Yes. Why would we prank someone as beautiful as yourself? You can trust us. Whatever shit you're getting from your classmates, I am sure you don't deserve it." - Vici commented.

"Finally someone understands. I should be the queen of the school, but everyone picks on me instead. Annoying fucking worms."

A metaphorical lightbulb above Vici's head lit up. "Of course. I mean, look at your beautiful rainbow hair. I don't know how anyone even dares pick on you despite that. How are they justifying such idiocy?"

"Is this sarcasm I am detecting?"

"Of course it isn't. We only want justice for you, queen. You deserve better."

"Yea! Come on, tell us about your problems. We'll take care of it all." - Adrian promised enthusiastically.

"Half the class likes to bully me for being a cyborg. For being a grivus. It's really pathetic how they cope with their chronic worthlessness by picking on me."

"I am really sorry to hear that. We're grivuses too, you know. We understand how you feel." - Victoria said with a compassionate voice.

"Oh cool, what kind of cybernetics do you have?"

"Wait, are we?" - Adrian asked.

"Of course we are, Adrian, don't be silly. We have very complex and experimental cybernetics which allow me to control ice and resist cold and allow Adrian to telepathically project his thoughts into people's brains. Give her a demonstration." - Vici requested. She didn't actually know the source of her and Adrian's powers, that explanation was just a convenient hypothesis to stick to.

Adrian telepathically projected into Yulia's mind, "Fart fart fart".

"That's really childish and not funny." - Yulia commented cynically.

"I don't know, dude, I feel like-" Vici pinched Adrian's hand. "I feel like you're absolutely right. Won't do it again, sorry."

Victoria pulled an ice maraca and turned it into a figurine of a bear. Yulia tried to touch it, but quickly pulled her hand away due to the figurine being too cold. "This is my power. I wouldn't recommend touching it. This isn't your standard ice, it's essentially indestructible and extra cold. I only recently started trying to make figurines with ice for fun, I mainly use this in actual combat where it makes me outmatch anyone ever, on top of potential to torture and imprison my victims. Just tell us who's bullying you and they'll regret ever being born."

"This is great! I hope I'll be able to afford these when I grow older. But yes, I have 14 people across the school which I would like you to bully for me. If you do that for me, I will forever be grateful to you and maybe will even allow you to be friends with me."

"We'd love that. Just give us 7K bears and they'll never bother you again."

"Oh, of course. You just want to take my money and run off with it. Typical."

"Why would we? We like bringing justice to tortured souls like you. I am really sorry we have to charge you, but we're in crippling debt due to my great-grandma being in a retirement home which costs a fortune these days, and my dad is in crippling debt from his gambling addiction, didn't you have something too, Adrian?"

"Ummm… Yea, my dog needs heart surgery and other stuff. He'll die if we won't be able to afford it and I would be so sad." - Adrian said with severe sadness in his voice.

"Yep, plus as far as I remember it also needs treatment for some sort of a rare disease, I think it's Coufluger's syndrome, which is also deadly if not treated. We're just regular kids doing our best to help our families climb out of financial distress, but it doesn't mean we can't do good in this world at the same time. Come on, you can't let your enemies get away with messing with you. You're too smart and beautiful for that."

"Gotcha. I can name you everyone I want to punish. I hope you give Fernanda and Linda some extra suffering from me, I hate them so much, I hope they get hit by a car. Even though the car would probably break from how shitty they make them these days. I don't have the money right now, but we can visit my home and I'll give it to you." - Yulia replied.

"Don't worry about it, you can give us the list of targets, their classes and the money tomorrow before classes and we'll go through all of them and give 'em hell. We'll need one extra thousand so we can give Fernanda and Linda some real pain."

"That's fine. As long as I get to watch you do it to them." - she replied with anger.

"Be our guest. Well, looks like we agreed on something amazing today. It's been a pleasure to know you. Have a good day."

"Bye now!" - Adrian said.

"Likewise! You guys are great. Don't hold back when you get to it." - Yulia requested.

"We won't."

Adrian and Victoria stopped following Yulia. They were in some sort of a commercial district by a road.

"Now where in the living fuck are we?" - Vici asked.

"I don't know. Is there a location tracker app?"

"There is. So, what do you think about her?" - She pulled out her phone and began looking for the app.

"Well, she's an entitled sociopath who thinks the world belongs to her. Right?"

"Yep. Notice the angle I took when approaching her. She is indeed very entitled, which gave me narcissist vibes right away. It felt obvious which were the right things to say: you're pretty, you're smart, you're great, you deserve better, your enemies deserve worse, and I was right. Reinforcing her ego along with convincing her that we are of the same caste helped us achieve results. We may have overacted here and there, but we're in. The 8k is as good as ours." - Vici figured out how to get home and began walking back to the school.

"How do you know so much about medicine? I've never heard of Cornfluger's syndrome before."

"I don't. I made it up."

"Damn. Now I've unlocked a new fear of you specifically telling me things I want to hear but not actually meaning them."

"Why would I teach you the dark arts of manipulation if I didn't love you? Here's a better question, why would I indirectly teach you how to counter the same techniques I am using on you? Wait, that's actually a valid 5d chess move, shit."

Adrian laughed. "Oh no."

"Fine, you got me. My real desire is to… steal your… Tanzanite collection. So I can put every single one of them into my clothes to maximize my style. Yes." - she said with awkwardness and joy.

"Interesting, never knew I had one. Must be my family's heirloom."

She produced a small laugh. "That was delightfully dark."

As that was happening, Kate and Jason were going to their home apartment block. They encountered a middle aged man with a giant light blue dog on the pathway the children were taking. Even for big dog standards, it was enormous: it looked like it could handle the weight of a 6 year old.

Kate was struck with awe. "Aww, look at the beautiful sky boy!" - Jason commented.

The dog sniffed the children. It was actively panting and wagging its tail. "This is the most gorgeous being I've ever seen in my entire life." - Kate admitted.

"I know, right? You kids can pet her if you want. She's a lovely little girl." - the stranger suggested.

Kate and Jason began petting the dog's head with no hesitation. After a moment, it stood up on its back legs and put its front paws against Kate's coat. She joyfully giggled as she struggled to handle the animal's strength.

"Who's a good girl?" - her voice oozed affection.

"I didn't know dogs could be light blue. Or is she painted?" - Jason asked, continuing to pet the dog.

"Of course not. She's of a relatively new breed

Our mad scientists were probably screwing around, because of course they were, and managed to make these majestic sky colossi."

"I hope there's no skeletons in the closet with these adorable sky wolves." - Kate says.

"They have some extra health problems, which is an unfortunate side effect of screwing with Mother Nature, mainly with their hearts and livers, but it doesn't make them any less lovable. I wouldn't have bought Sky if I knew the ethical implications of doing so at the time."

"At least you realize what you've done wrong. I hope you're doing your best by providing it with the best life possible."

"I do my best! I appreciate you kids being kind to animals. Kids these days are way too cruel to animals. There was one time a small kid yanked her tail with all his strength: it was so sad to listen to Sky squeal from pain."

"Give me their address and I will snap their neck."

"Whoa! I wouldn't go that far, but you have your heart in the right place. Sort of."

"We should probably get going. Was nice to meet you and your adorable Sky!" Kate broke free from the dog and gave it a few final headpats.

"Have a good afternoon!" - Jason also said.

"See you around!" - the stranger answered.

After walking away a bit, Jason said:

"We gotta tell our lovely friends about this. I wonder, would Vici be as charmed as we were or would she simply return a pleased smile?"

"I guess we'll see. Truth to be told about them, I don't know how much more can I be going along with their shenanigans. They sow seeds of chaos everywhere and harvest the money. It's one thing to fight people in an environment that glorifies fighting, but how long is it going to be before they become professional hitmen and lose themselves?" - Kate admitted.

"We'll be fine. Maybe if we ask them gently enough, they'll agree to set lines they can't cross."

"Sounds like a dream. In case they lose it, can you promise to bring them back on track with me however we can?"

He thought for a moment. "I don't know, man. That sounds like a difficult decision. As great as it would be to fight for righteousness together, it might end up being a really bad idea. I can't make any promises."

"Ugh. Whatever. Forget I said anything." - Kate said, unsuccessfully trying to hide her frustration.

"I am sorry, alright? It was easy when I had 1 or 2 friends who were consistently on good terms with one another, I don't want to just casually have to choose which portions of my friends would be run over by a train." - Jason replied, also with frustration.

\*finish rewriting this\* "At some point, you're gonna have to grow up and realize that you can't run from difficult decisions in life, Jason. What if they kill someone? What if they decide to, for example, collect everyone in town, put them into a giant cauldron and make human soup? Would you still stand by them and watch the show?" - she replied with mild anger in her voice.

"They're the first people I feel like were my real friends. They care about me, and they care about you. Don't give me a trolley problem, please." - he pleaded.

"Urgh. I can't believe you."

"I can't believe \*you\*. Why are you so insistent on taking my happiness away?"

"Is that your idea of happiness? To follow your friends into oblivion while they burn the world around them?"

"They haven't even properly started yet! Do you realize we are discussing a hypothetical scenario right now?"

This went on for quite a while.

Later, Adrian and Vici are seen sitting on a bench, holding hands.

"Wanna look up the state of the world's countries while we wait for them?" - Victoria asked, their phone in her hand.

"Haven't we been taught that at school?"

"We have, but what if they haven't told us some interesting additional information? Besides, do you know what's up with, for example, Israel off the top of your head?"

"What's an Israel?"

"Exactly, you don't even know what that is. Come on, it'll be fun."

"Thinking about it, it probably will be. We don't know if things outside the Motherland suck or if they \*really\* suck."

"See? I don't imagine Cheburnet having objective information on all this, but it's the best we got, and maybe one day we'll get to verify it together. I guess let's start with Israel." She began searching for information on her phone. "Israel… Was a country? Not is?" - she asked in surprise after reading the first few lines.

"Still no idea what that is."

"Oh, you know. After the second world war, the local jews and Arabs rebelled against the British who previously occupied the land. They left, and you'd think they lived in peace and harmony together forever after, but fun fact: they didn't. Not even after the Brits fully left, the local jews began fighting with the local Arabs, and sometimes with the neighboring countries for many decades to follow, all because they couldn't properly divide the land between one another."

"Oh, that's what you meant by Israel. I don't remember any mention of an eternal struggle between jews and Arabs, though. "

"I may have asked my parents for some extra details. But look: in 2049, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt attacked Israel together to liberate Palestine, while in reality plotting to split the land among themselves to capitalize on the political chaos and mass panic within the country. That's the year after the Summer of Suffering, when the robots overran North America. How ironic: all this talk of arabic unity and palestinian solidarity, only for their own comrades to stab them in the back. And apparently Israel nuked several major cities of their opponents, only for it to backfire, shortly leading to its complete nuclear annihilation by Iran, despite the international pressure to de-escalate."

"What the actual fuck? How were we never taught about a literal nuclear war?" - Adrian asked in shock.

"Good goddamn question. The European Confederation apparently just sent Iran an angry letter of 'please stop' and did nothing else, all the while China and Omnislavia provided the victims of nuclear strikes humanitarian support and coerced Iran into doing the same, as well as into nuclear disarmament. Isn't it sweet that our government is always so nice and caring, even in the face of a brutal, evil world?"

"That was 40 years ago, how come we never heard about this? You'd think they'd teach us about a literal nuclear war."

"Fuck if I know. Something something, it's irrelevant compared to the glorious rise of Omnislavia, I guess. Which one should we look up next?"

"Hmm… Well, we know China is still run by communists, Turkey is an imperialist theocracy…"

"Which is a terrorist state that wants to turn the world muslim through killing everyone who disagrees with them via suicide bombers and eventually replacing all infidels with obedient muslim androids." - She said with a very cynical tone.

"Europe is run by an evil AI who controls all aspects of society…"

"Who's jealous of the Motherland's size and greatness and wants to steal it for itself, all the while flooding the land with gay gypsies which would steal all of our money and leave us all impoverished."

"Something tells me not all of this is the truth and some of this may have been majorly exaggerated."

"Oh, you think?" - she asked with a sassy tone.

"We gotta visit these countries and find out the truth. Eventually. After we're ready."

"Should be fun. Now that I think of it, I wonder what's up with Finland. They border Omnislavia and have historically been cold to Russia."

"Let's see."

"Hmm… Ultra-totalitarian dictatorship. Employs miniature voice and video recorder devices to monitor the speech of every civilian and send any one who is detected to even slightly disagree with the government a severe electric shock. What is this? Where would they get the money to equip every civilian with that? It's gotta be some expensive cutting-edge shit."

"Yea, and there's gotta be a lot of people in such a big country. Like a hundred million, probably."

"Nope, it's just 4."

"And they never were integrated into Omnislavia? Damn. Their military must be insane."

"Oh hey, found the economy section. Kidnapping people from other countries and harvesting their organs. Blackmailing European Confederation officials. Selling cocaine and other drugs to Omnislavia and… The hell is NSRS?"

Adrian shrugged. "Did the penguins go sapient and make their own country in the ice islands to the north?"

"I wouldn't be surprised at this rate. What the… National Socialist Republic of Sweden? The Swedish went nazi?"

"Nazis are real?" - Adrian was also surprised.

"They're probably everywhere in small quantities like all kinds of psychos, what's impressive is that they actually managed to take control of a government and somehow survive."

"Hey, guys! We got the phones." - Kate said after arriving at the bench with Jason.

"Dang it, it was just starting to get interesting." - Adrian commented.

"We'll read about swedish nazis and japanese bio-monarcho-terrorists later." - Victoria put away her phone.

"The what now?" - Kate asked.

"Not important. Tell me what kind of phones you got, and for how much."

Kate pulled out a smartphone made from a beautiful yellow metal while Jason pulled out 2 larger smartphones made from a gray metal.

"What's up with the small one?"

"Kate got that one, even if it's more expensive than the 2 I picked combined and strictly worse in every aspect." - Jason explained in a tone which screamed mental exhaustion.

"I told you, it has 9 cameras and they're better, it's stylized to look like gold, it's made out of premium materials and is so much better on touch, it has better software support than this no-name brand, and look at this beautiful logo! Why would I not get that one?" Kate showed the back of the phone she was holding, which had 9 tiny cameras and a logo of a thin V drawn over an S, similar to the dollar sign.

"It has worse battery life, a smaller screen and less water protection, what are you talking about?"

Victoria made a long sigh. "And how much cash do we have left?"

"717." - Jason answered.

"Jason, that was the right decision and you know it!" - Kate replied with mild anger.

"I am sure it was. We could have used that money for amazing Murmansk snacks we never had access to before, but now we don't have shit and I don't know what to do."

"We'll earn it all back and more, it's not a problem!"

"Kate, I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's right. I don't know what caused you to choose a phone with double the price and 10% more features. I mean, I sort of understand the appeal, but right now we need functionality and monetary efficiency, not luxury. Like you said, we can earn the required money and more and get something even better for you, but right now, that purchase was just financial irresponsibility." - Victoria comments.

"You guys just have no sense of taste." - she replied smugly.

"My tastes are fine, thanks. I am literally a better artist than you are, and I don't even practice art as often as you do. You're just trying to do your best to hide the fact that you became a victim of consumerism." Jason puts the phones in his hands back into his pockets.

"That so? Wanna bet a thousand bears on that statement that you'll beat me in a 1 on 1 art competition? Also, rude." - she dared, agitated.

"We share all our money, Kate."

"You mean you have it all."

"I literally gave you all my money so you could buy yourselves phones."

"But when I buy the phone that I want, I am 'financially irresponsible' apparently." - Kate said, signaling with her free hand that "financially irresponsible" was in quotation marks.

"I don't have the energy to explain myself. How about this: if I win, you will forgive me 2 days when I do something that's crossing your line. If you win, I will give you 2 combat favors and won't demand any additional reasons for me to tag along. I trust that you won't exploit those loosely defined terms if I win, and I promise to don't do that either."

"Oh, it's on, Vici. You're going down." - she said with confidence and excitement.

"Let's do it tomorrow evening so I have ample time to get back in the groove and so we can set up our drawing software."

"Sounds good."

"This is gonna be amazing." - Adrian commented.

"Now that that's settled, can we go back to the store where you bought the phones and refund it so we can buy something more grounded while I analyze the market along the way? Seriously, we'll get you something even better in just 2 weeks." - Vici asked.

"Now that I think of it, there was a newer Svechka model which cost even more and was even cooler. Alright, let's head back there." - Kate agreed.

As the children went back to the store, Kate and Jason spent most of the way arguing about Kate's phone choice. Victoria noped out of the conversation pretty early and simply forced herself to overhear it all against her will instead of asking them to stop as she was browsing Cheburnet looking for info on low-range phones. She believed that not allowing them to discuss this in her presence would make them feel less like her friends and more like her subordinates, which she obviously wanted to avoid.

"God, are you two loud and so full of energy. If it wasn't for Adrian's presence, I would have been silently wishing the worst suffering on you the whole way to the store to relieve stress." - she thought at some point.

As they approached the store, she said:

"Alright, you two, we're near the store. After analyzing the market, I found a couple better models that cost less money, but they're marginally different and overall you did great considering you've never done anything of the sort. Even our first phone is a little worse for a similar price."

Jason shrugged and smiled. "What did I say, Kate?"

"On top of that, that shiny Svechka phone has less processing power than the Prolephones even though you claimed otherwise."

"I never said that." - Kate replied calmly.

"I don't think she did, yep." - Adrian confirmed.

"Awkwarrrrrd." - Vici said.

They entered the store. It was filled with various types of phones and tablets, some small, some big, some with foldable screens, some extra thick. There were also stationary and portable consoles as well as monitors and PC blocks in different sections. The PC blocks were really small compared to early 21st century standards.

The group approached a young brunette cashier.

"Welcome to Gadgetopia! How can I help you?" - he asked cheerfully despite the look of tiredness on his face.

"We'd like to return this phone we just bought." - Victoria pulled out the one Kate chose and presented it at the counter.

"The sticker seems to be in check, I don't see any damage… What's exactly wrong with it?"

"Nothing. We just bought the wrong phone."

"I'm sorry, kids, I can't refund the phone if it's fully functional and not defective."

"How could you do this? What you're doing is fraud! How could you sleep at night?" - Kate asked, frustrated.

"Not very well. I work 2 jobs with this one giving me no weekends, and I haven't gotten a raise in 26 months despite zero infractions. Venting aside, I can't help you without risking a wage hike, it's all in our publicly available company policies." - he replied cheerfully, smiling.

Victoria began speed-typing something on her own phone. "Damn. I'm really sorry." - Kate apologized.

"Oh, no worries. That's what we minimum-wage unskilled laborers have to do so we don't starve. But thank you for not dehumanizing me."

"I found it, he's not bullshitting us. This refund policy section in general is super long, I mean this has got to be some sort of a practical joke." - Vici read.

"Told ya. Watch out for legal loopholes, guys. Next time it might not cost just a few thousand."

"Thanks, kind adult!" - Adrian said.

"Bye. Steal a phone and refund it back as vengeance, please." - Vici said.

"We have security against that so I would just get incarcerated, but thanks!"

When they left the shop, Kate asked:

"So what now?"

"I guess the phone's yours." - Vici replied and shrugged.

"Yess!"

She hands Kate over the phone. Kate begins flipping the phone around and touching it, enjoying the material. "Not like any of us would prefer it. I really hope you're not gonna spend our money on everything that looks shiny. Well, not until we hit something like 100K, anyway."

"I'll try! Thanks for not doing something shitty to me over this."

Victoria walks to Kate and puts a hand on her shoulder. "I'd prefer not to. I just want you to be happy, and for us to be friends, just like in the old times. And if something being shiny is the most important thing in technology for you, like you're some kind of a crow, what does it matter if it makes you happy?"

She smiled. "Well now you're just patronizing me."

"Am I? I won't lie, I think your preference of looks and feels over functionality is really stupid, but at the end of the day… I don't know, can we just accept what we got and keep being friends? It's not like it'll matter when we have actual money, while you'll still matter to me by then." Jason tried to hide the frustration from hearing that.

"It is just like old times. I am still kicking your ass in that art duel."

"Good luck trying, sister. Not happening."

S2E4 Train People

Another morning dawned. The lab children are seen going to school.

"Did you manage to make a makeshift stylus?" - Victoria asks Kate.

"It did, but that wasn't the problem. I wanted to test out the camera, and apparently you need a 149 bear a month subscription to be able to use the camera! What the fuck, Omnislavian phone manufacturers?" - she asked with audible displeasure.

"I never actually opened the camera. Let me check if it's locked for me too." - she pulled out her phone to check. Adrian and Jason were on it already by then.

"Ha ha, my camera is- The fuck you mean unlock camera for 79 bears a month and 149 a month to remove watermark?" - Adrian gets pissed too.

"Oh nice, my phone just tells me that I need just 119 a month for the camera. Fucking. Brah." - Vici comments.

"Wait, I just remembered. I tried to download my favorite song and play it yesterday, but I couldn't open the folder because it was also behind a paywall!" - Jason said.

"Yea, we defeated capitalism, guys. This fraternist economic model of class collaboration sure is working out for us wonderfully." - Vici commented with sarcasm and dread at the same time.

"99 bears a month to be able to use files? What, do I have to buy a subscription to be able to use the touchscreen too?" - Adrian checked how much unlocking using files would cost.

"Careful, Adrian, the Big Brother might be listening."

"Hey look, a popup which offers me to unlock my camera, my files, switching backgrounds, Prolephone Games Pass and increased battery time for… 349 bears? Huh?" - a look of appeared on his face.

"I know, right? Vici, didn't you say there are regulations to protect customers against this shit?" - Kate asks.

"That was their initial purpose, yes. However, who the fuck cares about protecting the customers when you can protect your cash instead?"

After entering the dressing room, Victoria continued:

"Imagine cyborgs also have to pay a subscription to use their cybernetics or they go offline. Better keep that shit paid for months in advance so you don't turn into a proper quadriplegic mid-battle, if not instantly die."

"Vici, are you gonna do something about a rainbow-haired girl standing next to you and staring at you with an envelope in her hands?" - Kate asked.

Victoria impulsively pulled out an ice maraca when she saw Yulia before putting it back in her pockets, then accepted the envelope.

"Pleasure doing business with you." - Vici said.

"Don't hold back. Let me know when you decide to approach the main stars."

"Will do."

In the meantime, Linda was pretending to look for something in her backpack while actually watching the exchange play out. Her eyes widened, and she covered her open mouth with her left hand.

As Adrian and Vici walked together to their class, she commented:

"We should probably not open this in public. I can imagine it wouldn't make our job easier."

"For sure. I wonder why she decided that paying a fortune to a couple of strangers to punish everyone she wrote in her little death note was a good idea. That just sounds like a recipe to get scammed."

"Now that you mention it, it absolutely is. You know, back to our previous conversation, I probably never told you the history of predatory money-grabbing tactics. Scam artists have existed since the dawn of time, but this particular type of customer exploitation first started becoming widespread in early 21st century America, even though everyone did it a decent amount."

"Whenever something is wrong with the world or our country, it can always be traced back to America, can't it?"

"Not always, but often. It's honestly genius how they managed to gradually enslave their own population. First they attacked socialists, then it was everyone's labor rights, then wages, then democracy, until they finally abolished the abolition of slavery, except this time the name was different and it wasn't mostly black people."

"Didn't know they went that far. It's amazing we're still a democracy despite everything. Somehow."

"It's gotta be corrupt as hell, but I guess it's better than nothing."

After the first lesson was over, they went to a men's restroom, perched on a window, opened the envelope and saw 8 thousand bears inside along with a paper with the names, pictures and classes of the targets written with a pen in an elegant, but easy to understand font, with Linda's and Fernanda's entries marked with an abnormally straight underscore.

"Impressive. She really is determined to pay them all back for whatever they did." - Adrian commented.

"I wonder if she whispered their names to herself every time she went to sleep and made plots in her head on how could she possibly avenge herself before we came along."

A random boy entering the bathrooms glanced at the duo, visibly confused, but didn't say anything and moved on with his business.

Over the course of the day, the duo went through the list and beat up every basic target, with Adrian marking every fulfilled contract with a checkmark. After all 12 were done with, they approached Yulia again.

"Any good news?" - she asked.

"12 out of 14 are done with. Just need you to watch us to finish off the underscored targets." - Vici reported.

"Nice. I've been peeking at your work from the side and loving the results. 'Oh god, stop, I've had 2 beatings in one day already', 'Please, don't ruin my face, I am getting a passport tomorrow', 'I don't know who Yulia is but I'll never even look at her ever again'. Now they'll finally give me the respect I deserve." - she said with a sinister ecstasy.

"You're welcome, queen!" - Adrian said.

"Never call me that again."

"We may have gone too far a little there with that word." - he thought before replying, "Sorry."

"Anyway. I've noticed every time the classes end, these two run away somewhere and are nowhere to be found afterwards. I looked all over school, they're just gone, even though they always arrive more or less on time when the next class starts. I tried following them too, but somehow they always managed to weasel themselves out of my sight."

"Hmm… Have you checked the dressing rooms? Restrooms?" - Victoria asked.

"The first are locked after the first class starts, and yes I searched the toilets. I checked the janitor rooms to which we stole a key together a long time ago, no luck."

"Now you owe me the full story."

Yulia sighs. "Okay, so…"

"No, I meant later, I am just curious. It's one thing to physically overpower an adult, but stealing something as difficult as a key? That's impressive."

"Wait. Have you checked under the staircases?" - Adrian asked Yulia.

Her eyes widened. "No?"

"That's where I would hide, personally."

"Let's check them out. There's only 4 across the school." - Vici said.

When they went down to check the first nook under the staircase, there were 3 teens sitting on the ground.

"Psst. Here for some speed? It'll make you even stronger, Victoria. We'll even give you a discount." - the middle one said in a muffled voice.

"They're not here. Have you boys seen a pair of girls down here, around our age?" - Victoria asked.

"There were a couple of pairs. One of them bought a decent amount of the product together, the other came here and immediately turned around as soon as they noticed us and went elsewhere. They looked like they were running away from the principal." - he answered without muffling his voice.

"Nice, that's them. See, Adrian is resourceful too. Have a good day, gentlemen." - she gave Adrian a couple of shoulder pets, much to his pleasure.

"Wait, can I get some?" - Yulia asked the teens after stepping forward.

"Not so loud! But yes, you can." - he went back to muffling his speech.

"Can I get as much as I can afford for a thousand bears?"

As they went to the next staircase, Adrian said:

"Didn't know you were into meth."

"I'm not. I'd just like to pull a prank on him sometime by lacing his supper with it. He'll never see it coming."

"Sure sounds like fun." - Adrian awkwardly responded. "What the actual fuck is wrong with you? You make my girlfriend look like a saint." - he thought.

Next nook under the staircase they checked, their targets were sitting on their knees against a wall. As soon as they saw the trio, they tried to bolt up and run away, but Linda hit her head against the ceiling due to panic, and while Fernanda successfully managed to stand up, she was quickly shot back down with shattering ice maracas.

Yulia stared at them and grinned.

"Hello, friends. Let's play a game together: you will scream in agony, and I will bask in it."

Victoria approached them and began putting many ice bracelets on the targets while binding them together at the same time. Adrian stood back and watched. "How could you, Victoria! I thought we were on the same- Aw… fuck… Team…" - Linda said angrily.

"Can't hear you behind my 8K bears and a lot more well on their way."

"We had a plan together… But you decided that exploiting her stupid pompous ass for money was better… Oh, we never should have even talked about her…" - Fernanda said, struggling to handle the pain. Victoria considered daring them to explain the plan in question, but instead she decided to just shrug with an unphased expression and continue covering them with ice.

"Should have been born rich enough to hire me, girls." - she thought to herself.

"You don't look very happy. Did I upset you? Or are you realizing the consequences of your actions?" - Yulia asked, enjoying the pain her targets were experiencing.

\*blah blah, yulia and the targets were accusing eachother of being dickheads\*

At some point, Adrian and Vici sat on their knees across from them and watched the show, hands held together.

"Adrian, do you know if it's normal for former friends to interact like this? I mean, it's probably a stretch, but what if all friendships are destined to turn into rivalries eventually?" - she asked quietly.

"I don't know. I don't think our former friends have ever been this nasty to us. Maybe it's just that this school and everyone in it is completely insane."

"At least these people are walking money trees, waiting for someone to harvest them. I mean, you couldn't buy everything you wanted in the lab if you had the money, unlike here."

"They say you can't buy happiness with money."

"That's stupid. You can definitely buy things that make you happy with money. Not all, but plenty enough."

"Yea, probably."

Eventually, the bell rang, inviting everyone to the next class.

"Shit, we're late." - Victoria commented as she stood up to free Fernanda and Linda.

As they all went to class, Yulia said:

"You guys did amazing. You're so reliable, so confident, truly astonishing. I wish everyone in this school was just like you."

"Pleasure to be of help." - Vici answered.

"You know, can I invite you to my home today after school so we can discuss our future plans?"

"Do we have any other options?"

"You do, but I'd really like you to be there. We've got cake in the fridge."

"Cake? I love cake! Come on, why shouldn't we say yes?" - Adrian said excitedly.

Vici grunted in displeasure and thought for a moment. "Just don't drug us and we agree."

"Now why would I do that?"

As the duo were walking towards the dressing room after the classes were over, Adrian said:

"I'd really love some cake right now. It's gonna be so good."

"Here's hoping. Thanks for reminding me, by the way: we need to talk about this whole invitation thing."

"Yea?"

"It's no secret she is a psycho and that she wouldn't hesitate to drug us if she wanted to. Normally, I would never in a million years agree to this, because this is just russian roulette. But you sounded so excited to get some, and to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't mind getting some myself, and also I feel like with proper precautions our risks of being killed would be reasonably low, so say yes I did."

"You're too sweet. But you've got a point. What kind of precautions?"

Later, they were seen arriving somewhere on a minibus along with Yulia. The minibus was polluted with ads, as seemingly every car was.

"Welcome to Mramorgrad, the shitty suburb of Murmansk where I live." - Yulia announced.

They exited at the commercial district, which didn't look much different from any others. A small distance away they could see clean, white houses of various sizes all over. Some were big enough to satisfy a medium-time CEO.

After a small delay, Adrian asked:

"What's bad about it?"

"Living super far away from everything and everyone. But mostly our annoying neighbors who just love ruining my life and pissing me off on every step."

"Sounds rough."

"Can't go over the fence and eat some berries, can't connect my phone to their monitors and play my favorite childhood song clip, can't even drop some dogshit in front of a door. And you wouldn't believe it, I once wanted to make amends with one of them by bringing them a dead rat for their cat to eat, but they told me to scram and complained to my parents again! You just can't negotiate with these people."

"Are their kids any better?" - Vici asked.

"Not really. They're gotta be jealous of me or something: every time I offered them my company they told me to go away."

"You just gotta learn to deal with people like that. If there weren't enough stupid poor people to clean our boots, we'd have to work in these retail stores for the minimum wage every day only to go home and have no energy for anything else. That wouldn't be fun." - she did not sound any different from how she sounds when she's sincere.

"True. I wish our government would just replace these worms with robots already so we could all live in our personal utopia of the cool. Why do we need them, anyway?"

"Well… Nevermind. You're right." - Adrian interrupted himself before he could say anything that would jeopardize the situation.

"We're not far from our house. Only around 300 meters after we turn left."

"We are? Got it. Excuse me while I make a call." - Vici said, opening her phone, calling Kate and activating the loudspeaker.

"Howdy! How are my favorite little war criminals?" - she asked with a patronizingly affectionate tone.

"We're doing great. Look, we need a small favor: call me in 3 hours. If I don't answer or if you fail to verify that it's me speaking on the phone and not an AI, assume we're in trouble."

"Why would you go somewhere where you feel threatened enough to ask \*me\* for help?"

"We need some insurance so that we won't get poisoned or something at Yulia's place. Adrian… I mean, it's not a good precedent to start a friendship by rejecting an invitation like that. Besides, imagine how interesting it would be to check out her humble abode. It's definitely not an offer to decline." - she caught herself before she said the truth.

"Hmh. Alright, stay safe, you two." - Kate's tone changed to being slightly sad.

"Have a good afternoon, Kate!" - Adrian wished.

"You too! Don't forget about our little art duel, Vici. Wouldn't want to miss getting humiliated at my hands." - she cackled playfully.

"Keep laughing, shitface. While you still can." - Victoria said with a playfully sinister tone and smiled. Everyone said their goodbyes.

"Don't worry about it, guys, I am not gonna do anything bad to you. Why the mistrust?" - Yulia asked with slight sadness.

"We're military kids. Lifelong warriors. A lack of vigilance could lead us to have our organs and cybernetics harvested one day, and we can't afford that as we have plans to fulfill in life. Our parents would find us and punish whoever would do this to us, but it won't bring us back. I highly doubt you'd do something like that to us, I mean, you're really amazing and virtuous, but what if your family is different? Or what if your horrible neighbors would try to pull something?" - Victoria explained. She was a little surprised to get that reaction, but did her best to remain composed.

"No, you're totally right. The neighbors could totally do something like that, and so would my brother. I am very sorry about my family in advance. Just in general."

"Are you serious or are you trying to defuse the situation? If you are, we could probably still work together. I'm game." - Vici thought. "This should be interesting." - she said out loud.

When they entered Yulia's 3 story house, the interior was filled with expensive-looking clothing. In the room to the left were several closets, portraits of several politician-looking men, with a picture of an old, but not shriveled man with golden hair and orange-tinted skin being framed in a gilded frame instead of a standard wooden one. In the corridor ahead from the entrance there were several screens with edges around 1.5cm with a lot of text written on them, which Victoria decided to read while her companions were removing their coats. "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn." - one said. "And the four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another." - another said. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." - a third one said.

"Nice place. What's that text on the panels in that hallway?" - she asked.

"How do you not know this? Have you not been taught since childhood what are those?" - Yulia asked with an offended tone.

"Ask our parents. We were taught how to identify and capture spies, how to fight, how to take charge. Sure, we were taught some literature here and there, but it was secondary."

"Literature? Ugh. These are random Bible quotes, the book where the only law that matters is written."

"Yea, we've heard of it. But why did it talk shit about rich people then?"

"What? No way."

"Look, it's right-" - when Victoria looked at the panel with the eye of a needle quote, it was already replaced by the following quote of "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law".

"Well, it's gone now."

"Even if it's true, I am sure there's an interpretation under which we're perfectly clear."

"What kind of a book of law is it under which a rich person can get exempt from 'good luck getting into heaven if you're rich' depending on the interpretation?" - she thought to herself, but decided not to say it outloud. I need to drop a reminder that she had no way of knowing the broader context of the quote, but the focus of this book is entertainment and not a detailed analysis of the Bible.

After washing their hands in a gilded-looking sink both at the same time (to save time), Adrian and Vici left the bathroom and returned to the Bible quote hallway, where they were greeted by a feminine-looking adult-sized android, waiting for the duo alongside Yulia. She had a normal human face, aside from a metallic panel on her right cheek filled with several types of jacks. Her forehead bore an unknown insignia, and she was dressed like a normal human being, aside from metallic spirals on her arms.

Adrian and Victoria were both properly surprised. While the latter was finding words to say, the android greeted them first:

"Welcome to our lovely home, kids, blessed with divine right and devoid of sin." - her voice was soft and lovely.

"Ummm… I have so many questions, but also, hi?" - Vici finally found the words to say.

"This is the machine who serves as my step-mom. Don't worry about making her angry, she's not sentient and she's designed to serve us without question unless our request violates the terms of service." - Yulia explained. She went somewhere along with the android. Adrian and Vici followed.

"Aren't those illegal, even the not sentient ones? Because of something about taking our jobs?" - Adrian asked. The guests weren't paying any attention to their surroundings: they were staring at Yulia's stepmom.

"My wonderful husband is a single father, which is one of the few cases where you can own a non-sentient android like me. I am sure you must be excited to meet him: he will arrive here shortly." - by this point they arrived in the dining room and took their seats on comfortable chairs with armrests. The children took their seats.

"We sure are. How can we call you?" - Victoria asked with audible sarcasm.

"My beautiful husband prefers to call me Ovary. But you can call me whatever you like!"

"That's a nice name. Is your nice husband's name Chode, by any chance?" - she asked sassily. Vici didn't really consider the potential ramifications of saying that because of how tired she was at pretending to remain nice and supportive in this environment. Thankfully, Yulia wheezed in response. Adrian also exhaled and smiled.

"That's pretty rude, sweetie. He is a very based, godly, and beautiful man. It'd do well for you to treat him with the respect and appreciation he deserves."

"He might have overtuned your glazing parameters there a little, Ovary. I don't know if he would appreciate you patronizing him like that."

"Would you like me to bring you some snacks?"

"Oh, Victoria. I would say something, but I want to see your face when you do actually meet him. It'll be the one- nope, I am not saying anything more." - Yulia commented, grinning.

"Now you have my curiosity. Got any sweet juice, Ovary?"

"I'll take 3 apples, 4 if they're small, preferably not yellow." - Adrian requested.

"Oh, the juice is Boris's favorite! We've got apple-banana, citric heaven and strawberry-melon juice. We don't have any apples, Adrian, but we do have some tasty pears in the kitchen."

"Strawberry-melon sounds fire, I'd like some." - Vici decided.

"Pears are great, but not quite what I want right now. What about something more solid?" - Adrian asked.

"We have bananas and bok choy." - Ovary explained.

"Oh shit, I heard these are like cabbage but superior in every way! Don't mind if I do."

"Can I have my usual, mom?" - Yulia asked.

"You still haven't done your chores, hun." - the android replied.

"I am gonna break you into scrap one day."

"Sure, sweetie, as long as daddy agrees." - she went towards the kitchen.

"Is there anyone in your family who you don't hate?" - Adrian asked Yulia.

"Nope! My dad is insane, my mom is a clanker, my brother is a garbage bag and my actual mom doesn't want anything to do with any of us, unless she suddenly gets in the mood to try reconnecting with my dad only to break up again a few months after. I can show you a photo of Boris's room sometime." - she smiled and shrugged.

"Is that your dad?"

"Nope, that's my brother."

"You don't usually call your parents by their name, Adrian." - Victoria wanted to say, but her gut feeling decided against it.

A short while later, as Victoria and Adrian were sharing a bok choy, Yulia was sitting on her chair and pouting while staring into nothingness. There was an empty packet of strawberry-melon juice on the table, with its top ripped open so Victoria could drink every last drop. The children heard sounds of slippers slapping from some other room mixed with wood creaking. Shortly after, Ovary entered the room again.

"Kids, I want you to meet the lord of the house, the magnificent beast of a man, Mr. John McFreedom." - she stepped aside and made a deep bow. A moderately overweight middle-aged man walked in and took a seat.

"So these are your new friends, Yulia." - she nodded in response, still pouting. "Ovary, can you bring us the cake from the fridge?"

"Yes, my sigma." - Ovary responded.

"That's a fancy crown you got there, girlie. You think you're the queen of the world or something?" - his voice had a distinguished, yet familiar accent, and his rough, unpleasant tone of voice screamed "alcoholic".

Victoria took a deep breath and rolled her eyes. "Greetings."

"Dad, please try not to embarrass yourself in front of my friends." - Yulia said with no emotion.

"But how can we know they're not one of \*them\*? They're even dressed weird."

"For god's sake, dad, it hasn't even been half a minute and you're already bringing up train people!" - Yulia's tone shifted to disappointment. By this point, Ovary put a big dish with a large chocolate cake on it, and gave Victoria and Yulia an empty small dish with a fork each.

"They're real and they're replacing us, Yulia! You're not listening to me now, but when they replace everyone around you, you won't be so dismissive of them anymore!"

"Spare my friends from your lectures about them, please!"

"I am actually curious the fuck is a train person, go on." - Victoria said. Adrian also nodded.

"LANGUAGE!" - John yelled. Victoria made an exasperated sigh and closed her eyes for a moment.

"If you don't stop being insufferable to my friends, I will skip this saturday's game night with you and you're gonna have to play with the clanker or with yourself." - Yulia threatened him calmly.

Her father was shocked. "You wouldn't."

"You know I would."

"How could you do something like this? To your own amazing father, who does so much for you so you can grow into the best person you could possibly be?" - Everyone was silent. "Damn it, Yulia! Fine. Congratulations. You've successfully blackmailed me into giving your friends respect they haven't earned yet. Are you happy?"

"You are disrespecting them by saying they haven't earned it."

"Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden? No, don't answer, I can't blame you for being born with a pussy."

"Gross!"

"He is right. 'Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence'. Timothy 2:11-12." - Ovary commented.

"Why won't you take your own advice and stay in silence too?" - Yulia responded with mild anger.

"Yea, shut the fuck up!" - her father agreed.

"I am sorry, my gigachad." - Ovary responded gently.

"Would you two mind if we grab some cake?" - Adrian asked.

"Your friend can, but you cannot, unless you're a soy boy."

Yulia sighed, took 3 cake slices, stood up and left the dining room. "I am out. I'll see you guys in my room after we're done."

"Don't let the door hit you on your way out."

Adrian began deeply thinking about John's soy boy comment, and when Vici noticed, she tickled his leg, and started typing on her phone in the browser search bar: "He is projecting the insecurity about his masculinity on you, ignore him."

"Can I get a dish and a fork too?" - Adrian asked.

John grunted, but didn't comment further.

Ovary silently complied, and also brought John a large bottle of beer and some fish sticks.

"So what's this about 'train people'?" - Vici asked as she was eating the cake along with her "friend".

"Oh, they're everywhere, you know. They've infiltrated society at every step. Sometimes, they're born instead of humans due to satanic interference into our biology, and are usually visually impossible to tell apart from us. They also tend to infiltrate our bathrooms to spy on us. The government considers them mentally ill, like it's some sort of weird schizophrenia. They don't allow them to drive cars or purchase cybernetics, but it's not enough: they're not even human, they're satanic spawn, and they aim to destroy our entire society from within in order to build a gateway for Satan to invade the human dimension like that one game my grandfather loved."

"Wait, Oblivion?" - Adrian asked.

"Yes! How do you know that, kid? It's gotta be 10 times older than you." - his tone changed to pleasant surprise. Adrian also realized that it was a very broad description and him landing on the correct guess first try was miraculously unlikely.

"It was a major source of inspiration for the games of late 2030's, from what I heard, so I found it and beat it to see how far have they evolved since then."

"That's amazing! You might be a soy boy, but you're also a real appreciator. How'd you like it?"

"It didn't age super well, but it had that same wacky and unintentionally funny charm the games of that era had. It was definitely worth my time, even though the generation of games it inspired wasn't really that amazing aside from a couple hidden gems here and there."

"You're not wrong, the games of those times were very hit and miss. It's a good thing modern games have their shit in check. The American game devs from the twenties would have never made something where you can bomb the Muslims or massacre the Polish like it's 1939 all over again. God, I love playing those so much." - Adrian did his best to hide how he felt about that statement, but his face did relay a certain degree of discomfort. "What about you, princess girl? Are you also a gamer?"

"Not nearly to the same degree. I have no idea what you guys are talking about." - Victoria answered. She wasn't lying.

"Hmph." - He started chewing on a fish stick and passed one to Adrian, which he promptly accepted before splitting it in half with Vici.

"I'm good, they're all yours. Anyway, do train people eat coal or do they eat normal food like humans?" - she asked and moved her half back towards Adrian. The displeasure from Adrian sharing a fish stick meant for him left John's face. Adrian proceeded to chew on his half with enjoyment.

"They may aswell eat coal, I wouldn't know. Never met one in person. I wouldn't be surprised if coal is used by them as a catalyst to transform humans into creatures like themselves or to poison the water to turn people gay."

"They can do that? That's amazing, I wonder what kind of technology they use to achieve that." - she considered stealing that technology to turn any straight girl she wants to date gay in case things went south with Adrian, but then started thinking, doubting whether it would be healthy to start a relationship that way or not, before losing the thought.

"I was told you two are excellent fighters. Maybe you could infiltrate those train people and steal their secrets and their technology and present it to the government so they could make concentration camps for them like they did for the cholos in the 20's. God, I wish I was old enough to have seen those times. The government is fucking toothless nowadays. Tell 'em about it, Ovary."

"It's true. The government incentivizes us to respect all ethnicities, with Omnislavia caring about each one there is, as long as they serve the country's interests. I remember you being so upset about the amount of kamazons and namazons in the government." - despite the wildness of the last sentence, Ovary pronounced it in a completely neutral tone.

Victoria exhaled and used all of her willpower not to laugh. She expected anything at this point, but \*not\* a modern personal android exposing her owner like that. Adrian's eyes also widened a little. "Wow, don't think I could be more racist than that if I tried." - he thought. And yes, the part about the "cholos" completely flew over both of their heads.

"Not in front of the guests, Ovary! What the fuck?" - John asked angrily.

"I am sorry, my rizzlord. You've removed my restriction from saying that in front of guests last time we had them."

"Shit! You better not be telling anyone about this, kids."

"We have better things to do. Here's the real issue: have you ever considered treating everyone a little nicer? At least your family. It's clear that you want to be seen as a godly, based man: even Ovary is designed to constantly remind you and everyone in here of how "gigachad" you are. But maybe if you put just a little effort into being a nicer person, you won't need an android's glazing to satisfy yourself: your ex-wife will come back, or a new one would come around." - Victoria suggested gently with a hint of irritation in her voice. Both her and Adrian were long done with the cake at this point, so she was okay with the risk.

John looked at them in shock. "How dare you insult me like this in my own household? Haven't I given you enough courtesy by allowing you to talk in my presence? Who taught you to disrespect your elders, little girl?"

"You're only proving her point further by responding like that, man. Admiration is earned through extraordinary merit, care or virtuousness. What use is having Bible quotes on your walls when you can't even figure out how to talk to your 10 or 11 year old daughter properly?" - Adrian asked and shrugged.

John stood up from his chair and rushed at him. In only a few moments Vici noticed it, stood up, kicked her chair back with her leg, pulled out an ice maraca and turned it into a big ice knife, which caused John to stop.

"Feeling eager to get butchered tonight?" - she asked. Adrian stood up too shortly after too along with his remaining fish stick, slightly startled.

"Shouldn't have done that, kids. I am now legally allowed to beat you up in self-defense. You better apologize now."

"We've been raised as future supersoldiers by the military since birth. Not only we'll be able to fight back, not only you're gonna be severely punished by attacking someone whose soul and body belongs to the army, but we could easily trash your house and get away with it and you'll be several hundreds of thousands of bears poorer as a result. If that doesn't stop you, by all means, step forward."

"Ovary, verify if she's bluffing."

"I am sorry, my sigma, but I am unable to obtain the info about the first 2 requests due to legal limitations, but I would advise you not to try your luck. There's no information they could trash our house and get away with it, though." - the android replied.

"I knew it! You're one of them! I knew your mask would fall off if I tried hard enough!" He angrily pointed both of his hands at the guests.

"We don't even know what a train person looks like, dude." - Victoria said and shrugged lightly.

"No, I meant gay people! You've definitely been cursed by the Devil's grasp!"

"Well you eat babies." - Adrian said playfully. Vici's stance softened, but she kept the dagger in her hand.

"What?"

"You eat babies. Take that. Can't recover from that response." - Victoria managed to successfully contain her smile.

"Enough of this. Get out of my house."

"Your daughter really wouldn't like that. We're good friends, if you haven't noticed. You don't wanna risk making her dread you even more." - Victoria said.

"I am not going to stand between you two, even if I'd really love to, I just don't want you in my house. Period."

She was thinking if she should apologize or offer her services, but then she realized that she never actually wanted to ever set foot in this house again. "Okay. I need to say something that can't get recorded. Ovary, can you leave us?"

"Is it something illegal?" - Ovary asked.

"No."

"Ovary, turn off your microphone and play white noise. Turn it back on if I give you a middle finger." - John ordered.

"Yes, my saint." - she complied.

"Can you hear us, Ovary?" - Adrian asked.

Silence. "What was it that you didn't want her to hear?" - John asked.

"I am gonna be honest. I don't want to be here anymore either. However, we do need to hang out with your daughter here for some time. I can imagine you have some enemies or just people you don't like, and these people obviously could use some God's justice. If you pay us an okay price and allow us to hang out here for one more day, we could bring it to them in various ways. We can beat them up, we can vandalize or destroy their shit, we can kill them or even kidnap them if you want. That'd be a lot more complicated, but we can handle it. I am really sorry for what Adrian said earlier, we really think you're an amazing, divine person, and I hope that even if we went too far in our responses, we could still help eachother out and not stand in eachother's way."

"Yea, I am very sorry. I didn't sleep well last night and got irritated." - Adrian lied.

"There's no way this will work. We might have fucked it." - Vici thought.

John's expression changed to mild confusion. "God's justice? You kids make no sense, but I would actually like you to vandalize my ex-wife's car as much as possible and send me a picture of your job well done. She's a total backstabbing, lying, feminist bitch. I'll pay you 5 thousand upfront and up to 3 thousand more in tips if you REALLY do a number on it, but not a squirrel more." - a squirrel was Omnislavia's version of a cent.

Victoria's eyes widened, and she turned her dagger back into an ice maraca and put it away. "That's doable, we'll do it. We just need your contact info, her address and when she goes to sleep and it'll be done within the following couple of days, maybe even today." - she answered. "You can't be serious. How insane are you?" - she thought.

"Don't tell Yulia about any of this. If you do, the deal is off."

"We value your confidentiality, no worries."

Later, Adrian and Victoria were escorted upstairs by Ovary to some sort of a bathroom. Both of them looked tired. When Vici invited Adrian inside, the android asked them:

"Is something wrong? Are you stressed?"

"Don't worry about it, we've been worse." - Victoria answered.

"Got it."

As she locked the door and turned on the cold water to flow, Adrian asked:

"Wait, why are we here?"

She finished and took a seat on the edge of a closed toilet, leaning on the wall to the side. "So we could talk about this whole disaster. Let's see if we could fit on this toilet lid together with no problems." - she tapped on the other side of the lid with her nails twice to signal Adrian to sit next to her, and so he did, taking her hand in his. After some moving around, there was barely enough space to sit together somewhat comfortably.

"I am really sorry I failed."

"Don't apologize, I didn't handle it perfectly either for the same reason as you, if I had to guess." - she sighed. "I don't know what I was thinking he would say if I told him to be better. 'I am sorry, kids, the stick up my mussy was too deep, I'll take it out and work on myself from now on'. What a dude, huh?" - she managed to mimic his accent perfectly.

"I've never met a bigger crackhead in my life."

"You did great with that 'you eat babies' remark, by the way. I don't know if it helped our situation or not, but it was funny, and it did come across like you trying to protect my little secret, which is very sweet of you."

"You're welcome, Vici. I love how he came to the right conclusion for the wrong reasons. He's like, 'I knew it! You're a… poopoo diarrhea!'"

"Adrian, that's a British accent mixed with Eastern European." - she smiled.

"Well, whatever. Still, remember that guy in the lab with an unhealthy obsession over guns? This guy \*dwarfs\* him in terms of weirdness."

"Sure do. I don't remember him being that deranged. I mean, sure, he was definitely not okay in the head, but I think I kind of found it wholesome how he's so passionate about something, even if it's little handheld murder machines."

"Really? I don't know… But I am really thankful when this one wanted to kick us out, instead of apologizing and subjecting us to more of this, you got him to allow us to stay this once and then not let us in by offering him a favor. I don't wanna come back here ever again."

"I could probably handle this from time to time if the price was right, but you didn't sound too pleased with this all and I just wanted to… Eh, who am I kidding. I never wanna step foot in here again either."

"At least now we'll be dealing with a slightly less psychotic slightly less narcissist. Great."

"Stay strong, dear. It won't be long before we go back outside and go back to our friends for that art competition, or go trash that car." - she embraces Adrian.

"We could do it like in one of the games I played. We pour something cheap and flammable under a tire near the battery, light it up with a bullet, a pneumatic one or a stun gun will do just fine, then we stand back and watch it go boom."

Vici giggled lightly. "Sounds like a plan to me."

"What? Does it not work in real life like that?"

"Nope."

"But why? Wasn't there a law of physics or something which would convert the kinetic energy of the bullet into thermal energy to light up the oil on the ground?"

"Well, it's… No, I got nothing. We should get back to it. Are you feeling any better?"

"Ha ha, I outsmarted you somewhere and you're ashamed to admit it!"

"Oh, you think you're smart, don't ya?" - Vici asked playfully.

"I don't think, I know."

She poked his back with her index finger as hard as she could.

"Aw! What was that for?"

"What do you think that was for, fuckface?"

"You being jealous of my massive intellect and a better understanding of physics?"

She poked his back several times more in different places, and one extra time in his neck.

"Mgh… You're a bully, you know that?"

"Your bully. Wait, that doesn't sound as sweet as I thought it would." - Adrian laughed a little.

Shortly after, as they were heading to Yulia's room, they passed by a room with an open door and stopped to look around, their faces reflecting their mental energy being restored. There was a late teen sitting at his PC and quickly and aggressively typing something. His monitor seemed to be open on some sort of a comment section or a forum, and there were pictures of someone's feet, ankles, elbows and even enormously large honkers. There were also several pictures of some woman's face.

"That's the single most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life." - Vici whispered. The same sentence was written all over her face, too.

"Is this what an average teen's bedroom looks like? Are we gonna grow into someone like that, too?" - he was more alarmed than disgusted.

"I hope not. And look at her face: those eyes look ghoulish, the nose looks grotesque, and it's gotta be impossible to eat with those lips. Ew. As if photos of what I am assuming is her tits weren't enough."

The teen inside looked behind his back to frown before pressing some sort of a button somewhere to close the door.

"Why do people intentionally make themselves look as ugly as possible? I mean, if the point is to get less attention, why not use the smelliest, most disgusting perfume obtainable so it's impossible to be near you for more than 5 seconds without puking?" - Adrian asked.

"Don't ask me." - she sighed loudly. "I will never get this image out of my head."

When they entered Yulia's room next door, they saw rainbow wallpapers, a weird, wide, expensive-looking 1 person bed, a table nearby made out of some sort of exotic green wood, a fancy gaming chair, a cleanly organized pile of what looked like random bullshit, including a sealed glass box filled with 2 knight-looking robots fighting for eternity. As the head of one of them was decapitated, they ceased fighting, reattached the head, made some distance and started a new round. There was also a turned off monitor, a keyboard and a mouse, all filled with way too many rainbow lights.

"Welcome back from having to deal with that shitbag. Was he as stupid and overall unbearable as he always is?" - Yulia asked. She was lying in her bed, browsing something on her big Svechka tablet.

"Interesting man." - Adrian said in a cheesy tone.

Victoria closed the door. "Sure is. Shame we didn't hear more about these train people he was talking about, but I don't think we were strong enough to endure more of him."

Yulia stood up and sat in her chair. "You can sit on the bed. Don't think too deep into these \*train people\*. He's been scaring us with them for ages, just like the American government was scaring his parents back in the day with the immigrants and the gays and whatever, and now I have to endure it too because I was unfortunate enough to be born as his daughter."

"That so? Hmm…" - she sat down on the bed along with Adrian and began searching Cheburnet for any information on train people.

"Don't tell him I said this, but I find it super hilarious that he's been looking for a girlfriend for 1.5 years and not a single one he got lasted more than a week. He always talks about catfishing and prostitutes and feminists and scammers and how he's such a nice guy and he deserves more, but the reality is he's just that awful to be around."

"Ehhh… I don't know if I even wanna ask, but how does he chat with potential girlfriends?" - Victoria regretted asking that even before Yulia replied.

"Oh, you know. Calling them kittens, telling them they'd make a good housewife, telling them that god would get angry at them if they don't get together, an occasional dick pic because it's a 'power move'..."

"Please, stop... I am so sorry I asked." - Victoria looked and sounded like she was about to puke. Yulia shrugged.

"Either way. The reason why I wanted to talk in my room is because I want revenge upon Linda. Even more than what you did today."

"We could kill her, I don't think it should be a huge deal. Lure her to an alley, stab her in the throat in a school toilet, or better yet give her some very potent poison disguised as soda through a proxy: there's plenty of ways to skin a preteen girl. Also, damn, there really isn't any info on the train people online. What if they aren't real?" - there was no emotion in her voice, as per usual, at least until the train people bit.

"Told you. And while I love your creativity about all the possible ways you could kill her, it wouldn't be fair to let her off the hook that easily. She deserves something worse than death."

Victoria put away her phone and faced Yulia. "What about kidnapping or finding a way to give her, like, 5 deadly diseases from which she couldn't recover? Kidnapping might be complicated and will probably require employing some methheads around town, and I don't really know how would we collect samples of deadly diseases from around town without any risk to ourselves, but we can figure it out."

"These are delightfully diabolical ideas, girl, but here's the missing part: all these will bring her more physical pain than emotional. But I've got something that would hurt more than a knife and drain harder than starvation if we were to kidnap her: I want you to kill her dog."

Vici made an awkward face and Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Her dog? Wouldn't it be better to kill her parents and only leave her with the dog, or maybe kill all 3? Orphans cry the loudest of tears."

Adrian wheezed. "Wow, dude." He knew from a previous conversation that she felt neglected and misunderstood by her parents, even before the 20K token disaster, and therefore felt like an orphan and was speaking from experience. \*fix this\* He still had no idea what exactly qualifies as one.

"You're not wrong, but her parents were kinder to me than my own and… It just feels wrong." - Yulia admitted.

"Oh cool, you have moral boundaries. You're not so bad after all, mm?" - Victoria thought sarcastically. She was hoping she could get some extra money from extracting a more high profile contract, but it was not to be. "Well, didn't think we'd ever have to kill a dog, but I am sure you'd be willing to pay us properly, so we'll do it."

"No problem. Do it and 20K is all yours."

"25K and you also cover the costs if there are any."

"What about 18K and a portable gaming console I have? It cost 20 thousand at the time of buying and it's actually great, I just currently use a more pretty one."

"I'll search it up later, and if you're honest about it being great, it's a deal."

"Alright. What costs were you talking about, though?"

"There's 2 ways we could do this. The first would be busting into the house, somehow dealing with home security of the year 2090 and then chasing it and maybe even fighting it… No, we'll need the other option: feed it a bunch of poison disguised as food. And it'll probably be easier to buy it."

"Sounds simple."

"I doubt it will be that simple. It might have preferences which could prevent it from eating the chosen poisoned food or a good sense of smell which would allow it to detect the poison. I mean, I don't know for sure, but the reason they sniff everything is because their sense of smell is amazing, right?" - she was lying at first to prevent Yulia from having any reasons to drive down the reward before realizing that she actually made a solid point and it might not actually be simple.

"They do. We should probably ask my mom how to pick our target poison, and I know what kind of food Charlie likes. That's the dog's name, by the way."

"Your mom? Why would she agree to help us execute a dog, and definitely not in self-defense?"

"I would have thought you'd have known enough about AI to know the answer, you being affiliated with the military and all. "

"We dealt with it a little. I mean, it's the year of our lord 2090, but we're still 11 after all." - Adrian commented before his cheek was pinched at the hand of his partner. "Oh come on! What now?" - Victoria just smiled in response and didn't answer.

"Either way, watch and learn." - Yulia grabbed some sort of a small remote with buttons and pressed something. Shortly after, her mom came into the room.

"How can I help you?"

"Alright, Ovary, what's the best way to poison a dog?" - Adrian asked.

"Oh my god…" - Yulia facepalmed.

"Why would you want to poison a dog, sweetie? Dogs are nice creatures. Isn't there a way we could solve whatever problem you have peacefully?" - Ovary said gently.

"Mom, we're just trying to see how we could protect our friend's dog from being accidentally poisoned by us. What are the biggest, cheapest things we could accidentally poison it with?"

"Oh, I am so sorry. You have such a kind heart for being so considerate, Yuli. Here's the list of common substances which could be used to poison dogs:..." - Adrian made an entertained face of interest over the new discovery, while Vici nodded pleasantly. I'll spare you the full chatgpt ahh lecture Ovary dropped.

"So what you're saying is, some specific sugar substitutes are extremely poisonous to dogs and we should avoid them when making treats for dogs?" - Victoria asked.

"Yes. Avoid at all costs."

"Thanks, mom. Can you go back to cleaning, now?" - Yulia said.

"Sure, hun! Was happy to help!"

A few seconds after Ovary closed the door, Victoria said:

"You could probably find that information on your own, even without help. But this is still nice. I think I know what to do. We're gonna need a syringe, some of that fake sugar, and, of course, a ton of candy that naturally contains it. After injecting it all with sugar substitutes, we put several plastic trays all over her neighborhood, and the target won't be able to resist the temptation. We just need to calculate the quantities and for you to ship everything we need to us."

"We can do that later, I think we got the core of the plan ready. Oh, this is gonna be awesome to see her cry in school. I wish I could physically slurp her tears when she does that, but it would look gay. You guys wanna play something together for some time before we finalize it and part ways?" - Yulia was savoring the thought of the plan working out perfectly.

Adrian and Victoria looked at eachother. After not detecting any hints of discomfort or dread or anything, Vici replied:

"Sure. I am down to have some fun."

"Same! Nothing like some game time after planning a canicide." - Adrian added.

"Heh. Smartass. But, before we continue, can you explain us what the fuck is wrong with who I am assuming is your brother next door?"

"He left his door again for everyone to see, didn't he? It's all photos of Esmeralda Swanson, or Celestial, spelled with numbers replacing letters like we haven't seen that before. There's some loophole which allows celebrities to legally sell their nudes and get a lot of extra cash, with some selling their used items like broken dishes or toilet lids or even their saliva. She's not as notorious as some other e-bitches, but she did sell my brother a rusty old fork she used to eat with. Fucking lucky bastard, her."

"Do they sell bathwater?" - Vici asked.

"No, but they definitely could. I hope I'll grow popular and pretty enough that I could do these things too. What if I could avoid working a single day of my life and not even have to do any gold digging?"

"Why did I even ask…" - Victoria thought to herself. "I am sure it'll work out. Keep chasing your dreams, Yuli. We're here to support and encourage you." - she said outloud.

After they left the house and began walking back to the minibus stop, Adrian commented:

"At least the gaming part wasn't so bad. Sure, it was mid as fuck, but at least Yulia is fun to hang around when she isn't plotting how we could kill a dog or telling people in chat to kill themselves in caps."

"Or when scolding us for not being as good as her."

"Or when griefing her teammates because they pissed her off. Thinking about it, it probably wasn't that fun."

"It's probably for the best. It wouldn't do us good to get attached: we really don't want that person in our whitelist. Oh shit, forgot to write Kate we're alive." - she said before pulling out her phone to do so.

"So… Are we really… killing a dog?"

Victoria sighed. "We have to. 25K bears won't earn themselves. I am not thrilled about it either, we barely met any aside from a couple being walked by their servants, I would have loved to touch and analyze one before this. But we're just gonna have to suck it up and do it. It's not like we have to do it physically."

"Yea…" - he answered sadly.

"I mean, we can think about it this way: we don't value human lives, and we don't value animal lives either, so to us, they're perfectly equal, even if their value is zero."

"Not wrong."

"We also need to buy something cheap and flammable, plus some matches so we could burn the car. We could probably do it all today."

"I feel exhausted from all this running around and everything. Can we lie on one of our beds and watch something together instead of doing more work?"

"No. I will force you to follow me around everywhere as my slave and you will do what I say or I will leave you. I am a sigma… Female, and I am super duper cool. Bask in my glory, peasant, and be my househusband." - she smiled.

"Yes, my glorious sigma. I am at your command, master. I can't wait for my next whipping session."

"Whipping? What exquisite tastes you have."

"Wait, I thought we were doing a bit, no?"

"Nevermind. It's just that I am hardwired to think 'BDSM' every time whipping is mentioned. I am a weirdo, okay?" - Vici giggled.

"Bald donkey… smooches… mice?"

"Nooo… Stop, you're too precious…" - she covered her face with her free hand.

S2E5 Live Without Remorse

Later, the two of them were seen lying on Adrian's bed, watching something on Adrian's phone.

"Welcome to Starsong, the best music talent show in all of Omnislavia! Welcome, everyone! In this quarterfinal round the following amazingly talented children shall compete against eachother: Natalya Morozova, age 12, Connor Whitman, age 14, Aigerim Beketova, age 11, and Bogdan Petrescu, age 12! Sponsored by Willy. Don't be a silly Billy, put a Willy on your Willy!" - the last 2 sentences were narrated in a sped up voice and a package with a condom to the side was shown.

Adrian laughed. "That's foul."

"I wonder if they didn't have any better options or if they wanted to project a message of 'never have kids', which, to be fair, is perfectly valid. Look at how we turned out." - Vici japed.

"Heh, true."

"This should be an amazing disaster to witness."

When the first boy came on stage, the narrator cried:

"Everyone give a warm welcome to Bogdan Petrescu!" - everyone clapped.

"Greetings, Omnislavia! Ever since I was young, I dreamt of becoming a professional singer, and eventually started tirelessly working on being a better singer and writing better songs. While I enjoyed other arts and activities, none of them captivated me as well as singing did. I have a lot of room for improvement, but I hope that my level of practice will be enough to entertain all of you." - he said. A decent bit of clapping was heard. "I've named this song 'My feelings matter not'.

Woke up in limbo,

The collar chokes my neck.

I had a nightmare,

Another will soon attack.

Forced to go to office,

The spreadsheets I must brave.

Must ignore the boredom

Or forced to buy a grave.

\*loudly whispers\*

I want to be happy,

But my feelings matter not.

I'm driven crazy,

But my feelings matter not.

We are the workforce,

We fight for minimum wage.

Exhaustion's rising,

We can't just escape our cage.

My boss is laughing,

I'll never get a raise.

We suffer daily,

But our kind don't get much praise."

His singing was passionate, lacking voicecracks and generally enjoyable. During the perfomance a few close up views of people's uncomfortable faces were shown, and at this point the crowd suddenly started booing and barely anything from the rest could be heard.

"Oh, come on. How is this booworthy?" - Vici asked with disappointment.

"I loved it too! What kind of rich psychos or androids is this crowd filled in?"

"What if it's all AI generated and there isn't actually any crowd? They'd definitely do that."

Despite the boos interrupting the performance, the song still had a solid rhythm.

"Watch the judges give him only zeroes." - she said in anticipation.

After he was done, the judges gave the singer the scores of 2, 3 and 2. He went off stage and waved his hand at a camera. It was the wrong camera and it looked like he was waving at nobody.

"Oh, you cheeky bastards. You think if you don't give him a zero you'll look more professional in our eyes? Get outta here."

"Maybe the point is to fool the stupider portion of the population, and the rest will either be afraid to speak out or will have their voices drowned out. Like the last guy."

"Plausible."

"And now, we officially invite the amazing Connor Whitman to the stage!" - the narrator cried. The teen approached the microphone and began:

"Hey. I am gonna be honest, I am being forced to compete on this show because my mom wants me to be the best singer in the country. I used to love it, but she forced me to go through so much daily practice that I've been long burnt out of singing, and her insulting me for my worsening performance made it even worse." - the crowd laughed. "I am serious! I am suffering! Get me the-outta here! I don't want to do this anymore!" - the crowd started laughing harder. The teen closed his eyes for a few moments. The word between "the" and "outta" has been obviously cut out.

"Satan's kiss." - Vici commented.

"I am afraid you'll have to move on with introductions and get to the part with the song!" - the narrator said.

Connor opened his eyes. "I call this one 'Help me'.

Help me help me help me,

Please save me from this pain,

I hate my life so much,

Help me please, I am begging ye.

I like gaming and coding,

But please, don't make me sing ever again.

This really hurts, please help me,

I don't know what else to say, eh."

The rest of the song was more of the same. The crowd tried to laugh quieter, but it was obvious from the faces that they were still losing it.

"I don't get it. Is this performative or real? I can't tell anymore." - Adrian asked Vici with confusion.

"They're probably trying to push something onto the audience. I don't know."

When the teen was done, the judges gave him scores of 10 8 10. Adrian raised an eyebrow.

"I am starting to regret everything. This is the stupidest fucking thing I've seen in my life. I feel my brain cells jumping off a cliff into a pile of live chainsaws one by one." - Victoria said, despite her tone suggesting she still had fun.

"What if we see something even more stupid to a hilarious degree further on? Come on, let's see the rest."

It felt like saying no would make Adrian sad. "Fine."

The next contestant was Aigerim Beketova. She was an Asian girl wearing a lavish black dress with animated stars in space on it.

"Greetings, friends! I've been born into a poor family. My parents worked 3 jobs in total and my teenage sister also worked on a construction site, and we've been struggling to afford most things which weren't basic necessities. However, I am here to sing you all a song about how we managed to escape poverty and buy an apartment in the Moscow city center!" - the crowd clapped. "This song is called, ''

We lived day to nighttime,

For our lives we had to fight.

Life was really, really hard,

There was no end in sight.

But then came ConsciousCore,

It brought some bears into our life.

We could buy what we wanted,

We even bought a golden knife.

We just bought some cores,

Price then doubled overnight.

Guarantees the profit,

It will grant you light.

You should never sell it,

The cores will talk to you.

Randomized identity,

They'll praise you tried and true."

"Don't believe a single word in the song, it's a scam." - Vici said.

"What? I can barely understand a single word." - Adrian replied.

"It's a promotion of fraud. I couldn't mistake these words for anything else."

"Oh."

When the song ended, the girl received moderate applause. The judges rated it 7 7 8. She bowed, showed everyone the ConsciousCore logo for a few seconds and left the stage. The logo had a reverse C which was encircled in a normal C.

"Not gonna lie, this is a pretty genius trojan horse strategy to spread word of a scam. I am still puzzled about which part does the government play in all of this. Do they enable and tax it? Do they run it? Do they not notice it at all? What do you think?" - Victoria admitted.

"I think you're awful cute when you talk like that."

"No, I meant…" - she closed her eyes, smiled and shook her head, then proceeded to give Adrian a couple of affectionate headpats. "Flirtatious little bastard."

Finally, Natalya Morozova entered the stage in a standard pink dress.

"Hi. I am really thankful to be here, thank you for having me. I've had a really difficult life. My dad ran away from my mom when I was 2. She struggled to make ends meet and we were evicted from our trailer and became homeless. I was relentlessly bullied-" - she explained sadly.

"What's up, Vici, are you ready to get destroyed?" - Kate barged into the room and asked with anticipation. It was no longer possible to hear the girl on stage.

Adrian jumped in place. Victoria was alarmed, too. "Holy shit, you scared me!" - he explained.

"Heh. Kate jumpscare." - Vici smiled.

There were crying and clapping sounds coming from the phone. "Hey, Adrian! What on earth are you guys watching? Why do I hear a girl crying?"

Adrian gave Kate a friendly wave. "It's Starsong. It's so stupid that I am starting to actually enjoy it. We're almost done, wanna watch the rest with us?" - Victoria suggested.

"Sure, but don't think you can escape what's coming by dragging time. Eventually you'll run out of excuses."

"I'd tell you that you'll run out of tears from how hard I will beat you or something, but I am getting bored of taunting you, so let's finish watching this and get to it."

Some clapping followed by singing in the background was heard. Kate grabbed a chair and positioned it so she could see the screen better and sat down. Vici and Adrian increased distance between them and the phone so Kate could see better. "Sounds good to me. Can you angle it further towards me a little- yea, a little more… Perfect."

The part of the lyrics which the trio could hear were super cheesy, pointless and filled with awkward rhymes, while the singing itself was uninteresting and filled with voice cracks. Somehow. After it was over, everyone clapped.

"Why is everyone clapping? I get that she was crying and everything, but that wasn't even remotely good." - Kate said with confusion.

"She had a sad backstory, so I guess that negated the actual singing part being shit." - Vici noted.

"The judges weren't much better." - Adrian added.

"There's judges!?" - Kate exclaimed.

The judges gave the singer scores of 9 9 10.

"Oh no, it looks like our dear contestant has been tied with a different one! Thankfully, we have special protocol for rare situations like that, and now, the viewers will get 2 minutes to pick their favorite, and the winner will proceed to the semifinals! You can use the official Starsong app to cast a vote for dear Natalya Morozova or the amazing Connor Whitman! You can download it in…" - the narrator explained. There were actual instructions there for how to download the app. The vote ratio of already casted votes was shown on screen. Connor went back on stage, knelt in front of the audience and made a praying pose. The initial percentage ratio was 39 to 61 in favor of Connor.

"I don't know who's Connor Whitman, but he couldn't have done worse than she did." - Kate assumed.

"He said he was forced to sing by his mother and cried out for help, and everyone laughed." - Adrian recapped.

"Those bastards! He could have been serious!"

"There's a non-zero chance none of this is real, Kate, chill out." - Victoria suggested.

"Then why do their faces and their movements look so real?"

"Come on. You know what year it is. It's really not hard to CGI the whole thing and nobody would be able to tell if it's real or not without a close inspection, if at all, I imagine." - Kate made an unhappy sigh instead of an answer.

The percentage gradually changed to 65 to 35 in favor of Natalya, before her percentage points started to decrease again, until the time ran out and Connor won with 44 to 56 percentage ratio. A very long and sad "Nooooooooo" was heard.

"Is this some sort of sociopath comedy? This can't be real, right?" - Kate asked.

"See what I mean? Welp, as much as I'd love to watch something else now, we should really get to business." - Victoria paused playback and stood up.

"Let's go! I am gonna be sitting near you and giving you pets the whole time to encourage you." - Adrian suggested.

"Aww." - Kate aww'd.

"I'd love that, and I really appreciate your affection, but me and Kate have decided that we're gonna rate our results by asking people we know which one they like better. Those people include you, of course, but we've also decided that we won't disclose which of the paintings was made by who, not even to you, at least until this is all over. I want to show Kate that I don't need to cheat to best her."

"You're smart to assume I would have voted for you no matter what." - Adrian smiled.

"It was as clear as skeletons in the ground or birds in the sky."

"We're also letting you pick what we're drawing. Give us your best." - Kate dared.

"Oh, really? Umm… A nature mage! In the forest. With wolf companions. I don't know." - Adrian picked.

"No, great pick. I'd love to draw some… No, I won't say more. Great pick, period."

"I was sort of hoping you'd pick 'penis'. I mean, I would have asked you to pick something else instead, but it would have been funny to see the look on Kate's face." - Vici said while being given a side eye by Kate. "Yes, like that one. Thank you."

Kate exhaled and smiled. "Weirdo."

"I am. What's \*your\* point?"

Later, Adrian was seen watching a video under the white sky of winter \*verify realism of white sky\* about a green-skinned ripped guy with Stalin's facial hair in underwear with a fancy katana sheath attached to it lifting a giant metal 4-legged tank and slamming its "torso" against the ground. He then proceeded to frontflip on top of the tank, rip out its black and red power core from the side with his bare hands, disabling the tank. He then threw the power core midair and proceed to cut it in half with his shiny yellow plasma katana, causing it to explode. Despite being in the immediate blast radius of the explosion, the fighter took it like a champ, only having his body covered in some dark-gray dust.

Adrian then paused the video after he noticed 2 pairs of kids fighting in the playground with wooden branches, except it felt like they were doing it very wrong. There was one extra sitting on a bench and watching the fights, and all of them also were pre-teens. The sticks themselves looked about 1.5cm in radius and were filled with barkless spots, presumably because the uneven spots were cut off to make the sticks comfortable to wield and to reduce their damage.

Adrian put away his phone and approached the group. "What are you guys doing? That's not how you use a sword. You're not even trying to make these attacks difficult to react to."

Everyone froze. "Who are you?" - someone asked.

"I just can't help but notice how bad your stances are and how you're using only your hands to swing it around along with everything else. Come on, you gotta use all of your arm to deal maximum damage."

The kids looked at eachother for a moment awkwardly. "Dang it." - one of them said.

"Let's get out of here, we don't need this joykill's advice." - another one added, before all of them except one walked away. Adrian was confused.

"Nice sheath. Have you been taking sword fighting classes for a while?" - the straggler asked. He looked central Asian, had a cozy-looking dark blue coat, and for some reason had no hat on.

"Not quite, but yes, I've been doing this since I could walk." - Adrian was slightly overexagerrating with the first sentence, but it wasn't that far off.

"Cool! Tell me more. Do I swing it like that?" - the stranger demonstrated swinging his branch with the strength of his full arm this time.

"Yes, but you're swinging it too far and not stopping the attack in time. There's a whole list of reasons why you shouldn't do that. Also, why is everyone gone? I only wanted to help."

"It's toxic to insult people you're trying to teach something to, Adrian. I try to teach kindergarteners how to use phones and other advanced electronics, and it requires patience, respect, not insulting them when they fail and complimenting them when they succeed."

"I needed none of those except the fourth when I was learning sword fighting myself. Where are those coming from? And how do you know my name?"

"We're classmates, don't you remember?"

"Uhh, no. Are we?"

"Yea. I am Matt."

"Hehehehe. I remember. Matt Jackov, right? Your first and second names synergize greatly."

Matt turned away. "My parents were so mean to name me that. But yea, these guidelines aren't required to be followed, but the less of them you do, the more you risk punishing people you're trying to teach too hard, which results in them refusing to engage in learning further. Which is exactly what happened now."

"Good to know. You're a pretty strange kid. Are you one of those train people?"

"Train people? Well, like I said, I do train people in using electronics, no pun intended. Is something wrong with that?"

Adrian smiled and exhaled. "No, I meant the other train people. The kind that spy on people in bathrooms and set the stage for Satan's invasion."

The classmate laughed. "What the fuck are you on about, bro?"

"Don't worry about it, you probably aren't one of them."

"I am honestly just really, really boring, at least compared to an average member of our school. Being a Satan's agent who looks at people's genitals from underneath the bathroom stall doors is too unique for me. Anyway, can you teach me how to use a stick properly?"

Some time later, Adrian is seen staring at Matt with his arms behind his back, watching the new acquaintance swing his stick. His stance was actually good by this point.

"Keep the weapon higher… Higher… No, too high… Good enough. You got a hang of this so fast. Wanna try your new skills out?" - Adrian asked.

"Of course! Are you gonna use your own weapon?"

"It's probably a lot easier to wield compared to the sticks, so I am gonna also use a branch to go easy on you. Got any extra?"

"I do, one moment." - he pulled out an extra stick and handed it to Adrian.

He took a look at the branch before grabbing a hold of it with his right hand. "These are so thin, I didn't think they were that much thinner at a first glance. I can probably handle the discomfort. Also, the most self-control I have is not going for the head or the balls, so this \*will\* sting."

"Try me. I can take a beating."

"Good. In that case, en garde!"

The children assumed the correct stances and engaged eachother. A combination of dodges, good feints and generally quick, unpredictable attacks managed to get Adrian to land a decent amount of hits.

"What do your parents even feed you, these are some stupidly strong arms." - Adrian commented with surprise. He was also blocking attacks with both of his hands while Matt was always using one without any problems.

"Same synthetic garbage the whole town eats."

"A clean neck hit like that usually means game over. You weren't kidding that you could take a beating." - note that Adrian wasn't making these comments back to back and the responses weren't instant.

"It still hurts."

"Don't forget to protect your balls, that's the second time I could have smacked them."

"Wait, time out. Why can't I expect someone not to kick me in the nuts mid combat?" - they paused the fight and returned to saying their lines back to back.

"That's not how it worked where we're from. It wasn't common because armor against it was pretty cheap, but we weren't forbidden from targeting balls. Better safe than sorry."

"Yea, I don't think it's any different around here, sadly. Even if there were enough cameras to track everything, I doubt the school administration would care. Why did you include not going for the head in self-control, though? Is it also valid where you've come from?"

"As valid as it gets. It's not like we were getting 5 concussions a week per around 600 combatants since head strikes are easier to defend against, but it did happen and it was advisable to wear a helmet in situations like that."

"Doesn't sound like you guys cared much for safety. Of others, at least."

"We didn't, no."

They kept practicing for a few tens of minutes. Adrian switched to his ice sword at some point as his hand was getting tired from wielding a branch he wasn't comfortable with. Eventually, his phone played an intense song made entirely using samples of car tires screeching as a ringtone. They ceased fighting, and Adrian picked up the call after seeing that it was from Vici and signaled Matt with an index finger of his free hand facing up.

"Hey-"

"We're done with the drawings, bitch, get over here." - Victoria said playfully.

"I am so excited to see what you in particular think about them. She really wasn't full of shit about her skills after all." - Kate admitted excitedly.

"Told you."

"It feels weird to say it, but I actually sort of like it more than mine! I'd explain why, but it would spoil which one was hers."

"You know, I feel the exact same about yours, Kate. This is some good dot-dot-dot."

"You girls sound like you had fun. I am coming." - Adrian said.

"Don't come too hard or we'll need to clean it up afterwards."

Adrian giggled. "What are you guys talking about? That doesn't even make sense." - Kate said, confused.

"She doesn't knooooow." - Adrian observed.

"You'll get it when you're older." - Victoria said.

"You did not just 'you'll get it when you're older' me! I am a few months older than you, you know." - it was obvious from Kate's voice that she was also screwing around.

"Ok, grandma. Can you repeat what you said again? Your voice is getting a little too raspy there."

Kate lost it. "Fuck you! Wait, no, why did I say that, you're gonna make it weird again."

"Now why would I do something like that? Come on. That's not nice to make assumptions like this." - the sarcasm in the tone of that response was strong enough to lift a mountain.

"Anyway, get your bitch ass over here, Adrian. We're waiting."

"I am coming. Bye-" - Adrian got interrupted.

"Don't come too hard or…"

"Stop! You can't just make the same joke twice!" - he replied, full of joy.

Victoria giggled. "Yes, I can. What'cha gonna do about it?" - the call was hung up.

"Your friends sound amazing. You look so happy." - Matt observed.

"You wouldn't know the half of it."

"Well, have a good evening and see you at school. I could probably do this for 15 more minutes, but it was fun regardless."

"It was. I would probably have had enough in me for 5 more, if that: blocking your attacks takes some energy. Bye!" - they waved to eachother and went separate ways.

When Adrian arrived back into his apartment, he heard Kate, Victoria and Jason talking about something with his parents. As they were walking back down the hallway, Jason holding their drawings, Kate pointed a finger at Vici and said with excitement:

"In your face! Wait, what am I celebrating, again?"

"The prospect of you winning the bet?"

"Oh right, that's… The entire reason we did this."

"Ola, my bolas… No, I am not even sure that's a word. Pretend I just said 'hi' normally." - Adrian greeted his friends, waved and swapped his street boots with the slippers. By this point his coat and hat were on the coat rack.

"Even if it isn't, it's cute." - Victoria shrugged.

"How's it going, Adrian?" - Jason asked.

"Oh, you know how it is, loving life outside the lab, as always. Give me a few more moments before I'll take a look at the pics."

After washing his hands and going back to his room, Adrian sat on his bed in the spot his friends prepared for him between Kate and Vici and grabbed the printed drawings from Kate's hands. "Come on…" - she said. Jason was sitting in a chair nearby, and everyone watched Adrian analyze the results with anticipation.

One of the drawings had a highly detailed nature mage with a crown out of leaves, a dark green cape, a wooden staff with some sort of a spiky plant attached to the end of it, and more. He was also surrounded by some sort of shiny spirits or insects, hard to say what exactly. The 3 grey and white wolves and the deep trees behind them weren't nearly as detailed, but still looked great. Whoever drew this even bothered to make the wolves sort of dirty, and while it didn't feel that natural, it still looked good if you didn't focus on it hard enough. The entire drawing's color palette felt realistic and the shading was mostly on point, aside from that one spot on one of the pine trees to the right which was barely shaded at all, as if the artist forgot about it or ran out of time. When Adrian flipped the paper, he saw 3 small diagonal lines in the top corner. He didn't think much of them and flipped the printout back to the front side again.

"I love this." - everyone around him was visibly itching to say something, and by everyone I mean mostly Kate.

He took a closer look at the other work, and its much more vivid colors and a greater variety of them stood out right away. This mage's clothing and equipment looked a lot less fancy or detailed, it still looked good: a wooden crown, a comfy-looking leather shirt with a couple of leaves on it, and a tattoo of a leaf on his left cheek. He was slightly bent over so he could pet a wolf on his right side on the head while the other one was rubbing his head against the mage's other leg like a domestic cat. The one on the right was pure white and the other was grey and white, they both had detailed dirt and fur on them, and all 3 of them looked like they were full of love and joy. This piece had birches and oaks instead of pines in the background. The shading was also mostly on point, and even though a lot looked overshaded, you could make a point it somehow enhanced the result.

"This is also amazing. I mean, the colors don't feel nearly as real, but look at these doggos! They just look so happy, I envisioned this to be something epic and cool, but I love this too." - he checked what was on the other side. "These little tally marks again, except there's two instead of three. Hmmm… Where is the one with just one then?" - he thought aloud.

"We'll tell you later, don't think about it too hard." - Victoria suggested and gave him a cute little pat on the cheek.

Adrian flipped the sheet back and put 2 of the results side by side so it would be easier to make a final decision. "These are both so good! The first one feels a lot more photorealistic and detailed and everything while the second one more leans into cartoonish expressiveness, in a good way. Eh, I am going with the second one, these wolves look so happy."

"Yes! There goes your lead." - Kate exclaimed.

Victoria noticed Adrian's awkward face. "Don't feel bad about picking hers. It's not like you're picking between us and not between our drawings, and besides, I can't blame you for liking the other one. I would have leaned into cuteness too, both parents who voted for it also noted how cute the wolves are."

"Wait… Are the tally marks for the votes?"

"Didn't even need us explaining it to you. Yea, Adrian's dad, Kate's mom and Jason voted for mine while Adrian's mom, Kate's dad and you picked Kate's. We've planned to ask 3 more people to pick their favorites at school tomorrow."

"I still have no idea how did the idea of asking the fucking drug kingpin of the school to pick his favorite among these get wormed into your head." - Kate commented.

"If it was a stupid idea, you would have said a single way this could go wrong, aside from him shitting himself from fear that he will accidentally pick wrong, which we'll do our best to prevent." - Vici shrugged.

"I am not saying it's a bad idea, I am saying it's just a spicy idea. I even find it hilarious how absurd it sounds out of context."

"I also have one more guy I've met on the playground who we could get involved in this." - Adrian commented.

"Did you make a new friend today?" - Kate asked in the tone a mother would use to praise their child for something. Jason stood up, turned his eyes away and started slowly walking around the room.

"I think so, or at least I started. I think you'd like him."

"It's good that we, or I guess just you, are managing to begin properly integrating with the locals. I am sure something about him was extraordinary for you to say that about someone you just met today." - Victoria presumed.

"You wouldn't know the half of it." - he said before realizing he used the same phrase twice.

After arriving at school the next day and surrendering their phones and passing through the security gate, all 4 of them approached the security guard at the desk.

"Excuse me, but can you take a look at these and tell us which one is your favorite?" - Kate asked, presenting the drawings.

"These are remarkable for your ages. I thought you kids were fighting all day long and didn't have much time for drawing back then."

"Of course we had our own interests. We were generally just allowed to go nuts, which happened to include a lot of combat." - Vici explained.

"I am still impressed. I like the one with 3 wolves better, for sure."

"Thank you. That's 4-3."

When Victoria asked Yulia for her preference while everyone else was changing clothes, she replied:

"Hmm… Pretty amateur drawings, but I like the more colorful one more. It's a bit childish, but it has character."

Vici nodded and thought, "4-4."

They all got to the first class shortly after. Victoria and Adrian were sitting together on front rows, Kate right behind them, and Jason somewhere on the last rows, quietly yapping about something with other classmates. There were portraits of previous Omnislavian presidents on the wall above the smartboard and on the walls to the side.

"I've checked how well you've completed your assignments, class. Ostonsky, why did you pick completely random answers and when asked to write why did Abramzev defund Omnikosmos, you copied an entire paragraph from the Pravdapedia?"

"My dad forced me to work as a delivery boy, then clean what felt like an entire neighborhood, then more and more after that. I had exactly 5 minutes to do my homework when I got home before I was recalled to do more work." - a boyish voice from the middle rows was heard.

"He's not lying." - a girl from somewhere on the front rows confirmed.

"Seriously? Don't you care about the legacy of this country? You had 4 days to do that test, and you're saying you worked all day, every day after school and didn't have 30 minutes required to complete it properly?" - the teacher asked condescendingly.

"Yes. I had other homework to do too." - Adrian managed to visually track the boy in question by this point. He looked emotionless and underslept.

"Have you tried working faster and harder so you could get to your homework quicker?"

"That's enough! How could you treat your own student like that? He's-" - some other boy said angrily before getting interrupted. Everyone looked at him, but Adrian was too far away to actually see who everyone was staring at.

"Another word from you and you get a citation. Ostonsky, you get a delta. Adrian and Victoria, whatever your actual second names are, why haven't you done your homework at all?" - note that in this school, there's 5 grades: sigma, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, from best to worst grade.

They both made an awkward face. "Homework?"

"Yes, homework. What, do you think terrorizing the entire school gives you a pass to ignore your assignments? Think again. Your friends Jason and Kate are doing their homework just fine, Kate even got a sigma."

"Hehe, sigma." - Adrian couldn't help it. Victoria also smiled.

The teacher raised an eyebrow, but continued like nothing happened. "Maybe she can help you two with your homework. What do you say, Kate?"

"I say that you're a horrible person and should be in jail." - everyone turned to look at her. The frown on her face said even more than she did.

"That's a citation. What is wrong with you all today? Did you four have something to do with everyone being unruly?"

"Have you considered that you are the problem? You hear a student explain that he doesn't have time for homework, and the first thing you tell him is to try harder? Look at his fucking eyes, they're closed as we speak!" - she pointed at the guy in question. He opened his eyes, looked around for a few seconds, and closed them again. "Don't look at me with that offended stupid face, look at him and tell me this is a person you want to hold to equal standards to everyone else. Are you gonna tell the employed homeless to try harder too so they could buy themselves a home?"

"We already do that." - someone said. Several people uh-huh'd in confirmation.

"...Regardless, you suck. Suck less, please."

"You're going to the principal."

"And your wife is going to fuck your neighbor next door. Because she's tired of being around you."

The class started laughing, quietly at first, but they became louder as they realized there weren't gonna be any consequences. Some even clapped. "Whoa, where did THAT come from?" - Adrian asked. He and Victoria were less entertained by the phrase, but were pleasantly surprised by it nonetheless.

\*idk find a way to make this whole thing less shit, i really don't fuckin like how i made him respond there. also kate goes to the principal later, refuses to back down and it's never mentioned again\*

After the class was over, Adrian thought out loud as he and Vici walked out:

"Hmph. Homework. Who does he think we are? We live in Omnislavia, not China."

"He has standards to follow. If his students don't perform well enough on tests, he'll get fired, so he has to squeeze blood from a stone here. I mean, he's clearly in over his head, and he doesn't even try to treat us like people, but still. I guess he is just like us, caring about numbers while disregarding everyone's feelings."

"Should we find a way to blackmail him into going easy on us?"

"Blackmail? Come on. We can't hold the entire school hostage so they could forgive us for not doing any homework. Granted, it would have been fucking hilarious if we did do that and then siphoned more public funds out of an already severely underfunded school in the biggest act of racketeering ever so everyone was forced to sit on the floors in class and go back to blackboards like it's USSR all over again, but I digress. It was your idea to outsource our homework, so let's find someone to outsource it to."

"Don't bother asking me. I only do mine out of necessity, and I like my free time, thank you very much." - Kate appeared out of nowhere to the side of the pair.

"That's okay, we respect your free time. We could even find someone to outsource your homework to, if you want." - Adrian suggested.

"I appreciate it, but don't worry about me, I can handle it. So, who is our next target?"

When they approached Matt, he was fighting 2 of the kids Adrian didn't recognize at the same time with wooden branches. It looked like he had fun and the upper hand, while his opponents looked weary.

"That guy is a beast. Is that him?" - Victoria asked.

"Yep." - Adrian answered.

"He looks like he'd love to be in the lab. For a while. Until a certain point."

When Matt's opponents noticed the trio, one of them said:

"Timeout, there's 3 kids staring right at you like they wanna talk."

"Aaaaand we're kinda done, anyway. You win this one." - the other one added, and they both gave him their branches and began steadily moving away.

"It's been fun! Let me know if you wanna do that again. Hey, guys, Adrian. Is that your friends? Nice crown, by the way." - Matt put away his sticks into his backpack and faced Adrian and friends.

"Hi!" - Kate greeted him. The young lady with a nice crown just gave him a wave and a slight smile.

"That's right. Look, we were just wondering if you could take a look at these pictures and tell us which is your favorite." - he showed Matt the drawings.

"Straight to the point, mm?" - Kate noticed.

"I don't know. Just because I am an expert in socializing in general doesn't mean I always know the best approach."

"Don't be so defensive, it's fine. Nobody judges every single thing you say and remembers it for forever when you do say something wrong. Right, what's your name?"

"Matt. I am with her, though, don't even trip. Anyway, I like this one. You can tell the artist absolutely loves drawing. I mean, the other one is great too, but I don't know." - he pointed at Kate's painting.

"Thanks for your feedback, Matt. 4-5. Now I am in the lead."

"You're two votes away from losing, Kate. I wouldn't celebrate quite so early. By the way, Matt, you looked like a capable fighter back there. You did a surprisingly good job at handling a 2v1 despite being in the same size class as your opponents, and it looks like you can definitely take a beating. Have you been doing this for a while?" - Victoria asked.

"No, just 2 days. Most of my knowledge is thanks to Adrian." - he replied.

"Respectfully, bullshit." - Kate's eyes widened.

"He's not wrong. He's had a long journey before he got to this point, and by a long journey I mean he wasn't even remotely close to being this good 24 hours ago." - Adrian confirmed.

"You're a pretty strange kid. We promise we won't snitch, but are you a train person?" - Vici asked.

"W-what?" - Kate laughed. "You can't just make up a term and ask strangers if they belong to it, Vici."

"According to Adrian, they perv on people and plan to summon the demons from hell. And yes, he already asked and no, I don't think I count." - Matt smiled.

"Vici, did you two smuggle some of that rainbow gas from the lab without telling anyone? I thought you didn't do drugs, aside from that one time which doesn't count for some reason."

"I know you're just being a little dickhead, but I really should have brought some so we could sell it to Yulia for a fortune." - Victoria realized.

"Why does it not surprise me one bit that Yulia does expensive drugs? Also, what's rainbow gas?" - Matt asked. It was at this point Vici realized that she shouldn't be microdoxxing Yulia.

"Long story, dude. We can tell you later." - Adrian promised.

"You know, on a side note… I'd be interested to see how tough are you in one-on-one combat after school, given your performance and exponential growth. Mind giving us your number after school so we can meet up and fight?" - Victoria offered.

"Come on, we just escaped the awkwardness of the previous conversation." - Kate commented, laughing.

"Sure, that sounds fun! Are you a lifelong swordfighter like Adrian too?" - Matt asked.

"Not quite, but I have experience in the adjacent field. But you'll see what I mean." - Victoria answered.

"Ooo, interesting. Well, I should probably get going. It's been nice to get introduced!"

"Hold on. Would it be a lot to ask you to do all the homework for me and the lady with the crown?" - Adrian offered.

"Yea, we'll pay you 500 bears a week." - Vici added.

"There's no way he's gonna-"

"Absolutely! I'd… love some extra money, and to return the favor for teaching me how to properly wield a stick." - he paused because he thought he was getting interrupted by Adrian before continuing on with his line.

As they were walking downstairs after that conversation was over, Adrian thought aloud:

"He's so weird. He's gotta be some sort of a superhuman like ourselves. He even has no psychic energy readings for some reason. And why did he say yes to that horrendous deal? This town is not that poor, is it?"

"He didn't strike me as a very entitled person, so there was little risk in lowballing him. If he ends up emotionally valuable to us, we can always help him financially if he needs it." - Adrian had no clue what she was talking about and didn't bother asking.

"You really are an expert when it comes to justifying your own evil, even as minor as this." - Kate noted.

"I don't know what you're talking about, sis. Me? Evil? Get real." - she smiled and shook her head.

As Adrian and friends approached Daniel Esqueda and his friends, they instantly changed their posture and expressions from relaxed to focused and wary ones.

"How can we help?" - Daniel asked.

"Hey, we just want you to take a look at these two paintings and tell us which one you like the most. Me and Victoria were having an art duel and we need random people to judge the results so we could pick the winner." - Kate explained and showed them the drawings. Vici nodded.

The drug lords looked properly confused and a little scared. "Is this a test of loyalty?"

"No, it's not, don't worry about it. Just need an extra referee for something. And no, we won't tell you which one's mine." - Vici tried to calm them down.

After a decently long and tense silence, Yaroslav, who was sitting to the right of Daniel, spoke:

"Do we all have to pick one?"

"That wasn't originally the plan, but feel free if you want to." - she shrugged.

"Hmm… I am picking the right one. These dogs are clearly meant to charm you with how cute they are, and I can't resist it." - Yaroslav somehow managed to say that in the tone of an overexaggerated gangster.

"I agree. These birches make the whole thing look so colorful in general. What about you, Dani?" - Thomas asked.

"I don't know, dudes, I'm thinking the left one. Look at how much better the colors look there, it looks so much more serious, complex and realistic."

"It kinda does, doesn't it? I honestly like them both equally, thinking about it. But I have to make a pick. Can you give me a random number?"

"69."

"Mmm… Left one it is, then."

"Alright, then it's left, left, right. Did we do good?"

"Of course. Thank you for your cooperation, gentlemen, have a good day. That's 6-6." - Vici said before going away with her friends.

After she was gone, Yaroslav thought aloud:

"There's no way they were serious there. They were definitely testing waters for something. But for what?"

"I doubt their next test will be much worse. We didn't get here by being snowflakey." - Daniel suggested.

As Adrian's group was walking back towards their classes while trying to count how many people they're defeated, they encountered the principal on the bottom floor talking to an elderly teacher.

"Hey, I was just gonna look for you two. We need to have a little chat." - she turned to face the children along with the teacher.

"Kate, did you steal a toilet cleaner from the janitor's room along with Adrian while I was away so you could pawn it for a few hundred bears?" - Victoria asked with a coy tone. Kate raised an eyebrow for a moment before catching on.

"No, I meant you and Adrian. I have received probably a hundred complaints about your little operation and about how brutally and effectively you've managed to commercialize violence in this school, and I am ordering you to shut down your operation and find some other way to make money." - the other teacher stared at the kids in confusion. Vici was a little sad about her sarcasm going undetected.

"That's not fair! Why us? Can't we change your mind somehow?" - Adrian asked.

"I know you're upset, but I am afraid you can't. Whatever you'd be willing to use as leverage to change my mind, the amount of funding this school gets scales with the amount of enrolled students, and if too many of them quit, the rest of us will be forced to eat drywall for dinner."

"We're just gonna have to cut our losses, unfortunately. Doesn't look like there's a way out of this." - Victoria commented. Surprisingly, unlike Adrian, she didn't sound upset at all. A thought to ask the principal for her take on which drawing she prefers crossed Vici's mind, but she figured the principal had a lot on her mind at the time and it would be awkward to be told "no".

After the trio went ahead, Adrian exclaimed: "Fuck!"

"No more baby hitman services for everyone in our school. I should have known it would end this way." - Kate said.

"It's not the end of the world, you two. We've made a decent haul of money, and established our reputation. There's probably still ways we could get more lucrative quests based on said reputation."

"That's how you talk when you don't like something and are trying to convince yourself that it's all fine." - Adrian observed.

"I never said I don't care." - she made a long sigh. "It's definitely a major setback. But we'll figure a way out of this, right? We always do."

"What are you guys gonna do about the contracts you've already been paid for? You're not gonna scam them out of what they've paid for already, are you?"

"...Good question. Doing something like that is horrible for optics, but refunding that much money will be a massive loss too. I don't know…"

"Can we finish these contracts anyway and take our chances with the principal?" - Adrian suggested.

"That's a disaster waiting to happen." - Kate turned her face away from her friends.

"I disagree. Despite this school being an absolute warzone, somehow it's principal doesn't seem to be that aggressive. It's like outfits like ours are an everyday occurence for her. I say we take our chances with her." - sadness began seeping through Vici's voice.

"How do we decide who would be the final judge of your art duel? You told me that everything we need for the big jobs should arrive by the time we get home and we won't need to drop by any stores." - Adrian brought up.

"Well, we don't need to, but we can. Maybe there's a couple of booths or shops on our way."

"Why not just ask a completely random kid in the hallway and be done with it?" - Kate suggested. Her friends looked at her awkwardly in awkward silence for a few seconds. "Why are you looking at me like I said something stupid? We're-"

"No, you're right, I just can't believe neither of us thought of that. Somehow." - she turned towards a random male student in a hallway slightly older than her sitting on the floor against a wall and staring into nothingness. "Hey, mind if you take a look at these photos and tell us which one you like more?" - she showed him the drawings.

The kid looked very confused by the request, but after around 7 seconds, he gave his answer in an emotionless voice: "The one on the right."

Kate clapped and pointed a finger gun at Victoria. "Get shit on."

"We got a winner!" - Adrian commented with excitement and clapped.

The group walked away from the floor child as Adrian waved him goodbye and leant against a wall near their next class. "You got me. I could definitely have won this if we did another round and if I had some more time, but you've come a long way on your journey and I am proud of you for that." - Vici gave Kate a tender smile.

"I also think you did great, especially considering this isn't even that much of a focus for you. We haven't seen eachother draw since back then."

Victoria looked down on the ground. "Yes. Since back then." - she said with a depressed tone. Kate and Adrian stared at her and eachother with grief for some time before the bell invited them all to class.

As Adrian and Vici left school, still holding hands, Adrian asked:

"Any ideas for what we're doing after we're done today?"

"Why doesn't looking for random videos to watch not work anymore?"

"Huh? No, I meant in terms of work. Our bullying operation got cease and desisted, I doubt Yulia will keep showering us with contracts so much that we won't ever need anything else. I know you have a couple of other ideas."

\*comment: it's robbing a store, drug dealing and catfishing\*

"I have a couple, all of them require preparation, though." - she turned her head around as she heard someone running at them. It was Kate. "You're fast. Didn't you want to check out the nearby park after school?"

"I do, I just… I can't hold it in any longer. I want to talk to you about something. One on one." - Kate requested awkwardly.

"Is this about Adrian?"

"...No."

"Then he stays. We don't keep any secrets. What's up?" - Adrian was very pleased to hear that.

"I just wanted to apologize. For the Krovoslawsky situation. I am so sorry for the way I acted. I hope you can forgive me."

Vici looked down and thought for a decent while. Everyone's faces turned grim. "I am glad you're saying this now and that we're friends again like nothing happened. But I don't know if I could ever forget what happened. Even though it was almost half our lives ago, I don't think I could ever swallow the shock I felt at a time. Didn't help that I was around 6 at the time, either."

"We should have known better. You were never known as a liar or a drama queen before. I really hope I can make it up to you, somehow." - a blush began creeping up her face.

"What's done is done, Kate. It made me who I am now. I've gotten strong and skilled in these years, and it never would have happened if my early childhood was as smooth as yours."

A long silence followed after being interrupted by Adrian. "I remember how I noticed a pool of blood near your favorite bench around 2 and a half years ago being cleaned by the adults. They were telling everyone who noticed that there was nothing to see and that everything was fine, but their crimson rags told another story."

"Yea, that was me. They even made a small droid follow me everywhere I went until I've gotten more stable. But it's nothing new. All people are destined to face the void eventually, I just faced it earlier than usual."

Kate tried to get a word out before backpedalling and only letting a letter "Y" out. "But you were clearly not ready. And the magnitude of what you've gone through sounds insurmountable. Don't you ever feel like depression drains your physical and mental energy along with making you feel dumber?"

Victoria looked at Adrian. "Of course I do. It's horrible. But think about it rationally: I don't feel bad for anyone who stands in my way. It's like a rare superpower. Just imagine how many people out there could be chasing their dreams and mastering reality if they weren't inhibited by how they felt about other people and their feelings. That old lady over there could have been living in a mansion and escorted by armed guards, and this dude could have been managing a local branch of Svechka and dressed in an LED winter coat instead of that ugly vomit-colored one." - Kate listened in horror.

"Rude!" - the middle aged stranger frowned at the group and continued on with his day.

"What I am saying is, what I went through was a rite of passage into godhood. It was a nasty situation, but I couldn't be here without it."

"It makes sense, but… I don't know. I feel like there's something I could do to help, I just don't know what exactly."

"Of course there is. Spending time with me, of course. You alright, Kate? I know we've never seen snow in person before this week, but these snowy dead bushes can't be that fascinating." - when Kate turned her face back towards her friends, most of her face was red and she looked very sad and stressed. "You don't believe me, do you?"

Kate sighed. "No. I don't. But I mostly just feel horrible for what I turned you into. You used to be so playful, so selfless, so eager to share anything interesting you've discovered even if most of us rarely found it as such, and you've always looked on the bright side of things and did your best to cheer everyone up regardless of how deep in shit we ended up in." - she gradually started crying as she was saying this.

Victoria turned away her face too for a moment to hide away her disgust. "Gross. I don't wanna think about that. I am sorry you had to-." - she interrupted herself after realizing this isn't the appropriate time to say that and that she should instead think of a way to calm Kate down. After a few seconds of mild panic, she looked at Adrian and whispered, "Oh my god, help".

He's been infected with panic too for a few moments before walking to the side of Kate and embracing her as she was wiping off the tears with a tissue.

"We love you." - he said with zero confidence that it would help before the group stopped walking and Vici joined in.

"I don't know what can I say. What happened, happened. We were 6 and the world around us encouraged us to be brutal. Don't beat yourself up over this, sister." - a tense silence interrupted by quiet sobbing followed. "If you can't help it, you can redeem yourself by being nice and being a friend to me. It's been amazing talking and hanging out together like nothing happened, and I'd love it if we kept going."

"I forfeit my win in the duel. We can pretend you won." - Kate was starting to get finished with crying.

"Not how that works, Kate. You see, you've been scammed. I would have loved an excuse to spend extra time with you, especially if it's going hunting, and if I lost, I would have had one. It was a win-win deal and you agreed to it. Careful next time." - depression left Victoria's voice and has been replaced with the same playful tone she always uses when talking with friends, even if it wasn't as potent as always.

"Come on, Kate. If that wasn't the sweetest thing you've heard in your life, I am scared to know what was." - Adrian added.

"It might have been. I was wrong, it's still you underneath that hockey mask. I didn't know how much I missed you."

"We did it!"

"Of course it's me. Think of it as a new beginning." - Vici suggested. The group continued walking, Kate in the middle this time. "We'll probably have some free time in the evening today. You're welcome to join us in watching something, maybe we can even let you pick what to watch. What if not all of your tastes are bad?"

"Then join in I will. Let me know when you're done. I am gonna go check out the park and just think in silence. Stay out of trouble, you two." - Kate simultaneously gave Adrian and Vici some headpats, stopped and pulled out her phone.

"Take care!" - Adrian said as he was looking back. Vici turned around and moonwalked for a few moments before waving Kate goodbye and turning back forward and taking Adrian's hand again.

"You know, just between us, I do feel bad about what she did, even if I still love hanging with her to no end. It's not a big deal anymore, but still. But I don't want her to feel despair over this, the apology was more than enough."

"I am glad that's true. Were you lying about you becoming stronger as a result too?"

"No. I mean, you said it yourself, it made sense."

Adrian produced a tense exhale. "We should really switch topics. You were so sad for most of that conversation." - he suggested emptily.

"I wouldn't call it sad, it's closer to 'deep in thought', but no complaints from me." - that elaboration confused Adrian further, but investing any more mental energy into that conversation was the last thing he wanted.

When they got to Adrian's apartment, they saw a giant pile of delivered boxes on the terrace. Victoria instantly began checking them for contents as soon as she noticed.

"Would you look at that, looks like it's all here. Matches, plastic trays, syringes… 7 out of 7.

Thank you, random Omzon employee, I hope you know what's a bathroom."

\*there was also flammable liquid, sugar substitue, candy, raincoats\*

"Welcome home, guys. I see you've ordered a very weird assortment of items. Are you planning to run some experiments?" - Adrian's dad asked.

"That about sums it up."

"Well, okay. Try not to hurt anyone or damage anything, and have fun! And don't stay up too late, there might be vampires around."

"Thanks, dad." - Adrian's mood has recovered since the previous conversation. No attention was paid to anything he said.

For a decent while later, Victoria and Adrian were injecting a sugar substitute solution into the candy with the syringes and evenly distributing the results across 10 plastic trays.

"Why wouldn't purple beat cyan, Vici? It's mysterious and it for sure has a ton of cool chaotic moves barely any color would be able to resist."

"Barely any, excluding cyan. It would be piss easy to trap purple in ice before purple could even begin any of its unique moves."

"But purple also has connections to royalty. It definitely has enough money to hire a lot of allies and overwhelm cyan with sheer numbers!"

"How would that help? Cyan would simply trap everyone in ice, and everyone would be too preoccupied being a popsicle to fight back."

"Ugh. You couldn't be more wrong. Can we at least agree both purple or cyan would beat red?" - a thought that she had a point crossed Adrian's mind, but it was instantly shoo'd away.

"That's red's main gimmick. Lying on the ground in a pool of blood. I mean, even brown or pink would beat red."

"Well, I wouldn't know about brown…"

That conversation took a ton of turns, but in one form or another continued well into the duo walking down towards an apartment block one bus stop away and dropping the trays with extra sweetened candy randomly to the sides of different walkways. As they were done with 7 trays out of 10, Victoria commented:

"Man, we've been at this conversation for ages. I think at this point we've explored this conversation deep enough that we could write a book about colors fighting one another.'

"You sure sound like you'd love to do that when we're done being the scum of society." - Adrian's tone reflected how much fun he was having.

"No." - Vici giggled. "Well, if you want to, I wouldn't mind. But otherwise, how about no? And, come on. Don't think of us that way. You know they're the scum of society, not us."

"You're right. I wish I was as numb as you to all this, but I am sure I'll get better eventually. Right?"

"Of course you will. I am here to support you along your journey." - Adrian has received more affectionate headpats. "I would hug you, but my other arm is full."

"It's the sentiment that counts to me. Thank you, honey."

After going back home to wait until it's darker while watching a highly inaccurate sword fighting tutorial, unload their school backpacks and load each of them with a 5L bottles of the abovementioned liquid, then putting on their new brown and green raincoats, the definitely-not-heroes ventured back onto the streets of Murmansk. Victoria even left the crown at home, so they looked nearly identical from behind.

"We look ridiculous. I know we need to be unrecognizable, but I am getting a feeling that wearing raincoats in winter will only make us stand out more. Hell, it's not even slowing or blizzarding." - Adrian was almost laughing.

"Maybe I shouldn't have stinged out on our clothing. But then, it's not like our firework show will have much consequences if we do get caught, so we may aswell experiment to see how competent the local law enforcement is." - she remembered mid sentence that she forgot to notify Yulia about "feeding" the dog and proceeded to do exactly that before putting away the phone back in the pocket and taking Adrian's hand again.

"I love that they let us get away with all this shit. Hell, our entire block got 3 days detention for burning a dude alive that one time."

"Ugh. I remember. I was livid about getting dragged into it because our block wanted to complete a 'lynch a random newcomer' bingo square. And I had to work with my former friends to appease the teacher, who abandoned me like a used tissue and who I still haven't fully made peace with. Fucking shitshow."

"Other kids from the lab scare me sometimes. I know I have to be strong and suppress that fear, but it's so hard sometimes."

"Of course it is, but don't beat yourself over it. Maybe we'll get an assasination job and you can be the one doing the honors of slitting the target's throat: that should do the trick once and for all." - Vici said in a very supportive and gentle tone.

"I can do that."

After taking a bus towards the target car, they missed their target by 2 bus stops due to being way too invested in watching a video explaining a conspiracy theory about the French being headless and had to wait for another bus to drive them where they were meant to exit, then another one for a transit, and walking around 1.7km to their actual destination which was somewhere in a specific apartment block, putting on 2 medical masks a few blocks away.

They began searching for the target car. Every single one of them had logos of different colors and a different base color, yet all of them felt the exact same. "Hmm… BC, KQ, LI, SX… Adrian, what's your sigma?" - Victoria asked.

"Can't find any KQ's… Wait, did you say 'KQ' yourself?"

"Oh, fuck. Yea, there it is. Silver KQ873SMX. How could I miss it? I am smarter than this." - it was a proper 4-seater car unlike most of what the group has seen so far. It was nonetheless pretty small and covered in an overwhelming amount of ads.

"Mistakes happen. Let's do this. Ugh, can't breathe for shit."

"Wait, I got you." - Vici put down her backpack, created an ice knife and cut a small but sufficient mouth hole in Adrian's mask, then her own.

"You're the best, thank you."

She looked around to see if there were any pedestrians. There were a couple, but none close or moving in their direction. "You're welcome. Good thing we're not in a pandemic. Let's \*actually\* do this, I'll coat the right tires, you can have the left. Try not to get too much on your clothes."

"I'll be okay, don't worry."

"Better safe than sorry."

They put down their backpacks, pulled out a bottle of a liquid with a weird name Adrian absolutely wouldn't be able to mentally register and proceeded to quickly but thoroughly coat the tires with it, pouring some on. They then pulled out their matches, lit them up and started throwing them at the puddles beneath the tires from a safe distance. They were extinguished before they even hit the ground.

"What the… The matches aren't working." - Adrian was very confused. Both of them tried again a few more times, but nothing changed.

"Mine can't reach their target in time either. The air must be blowing out the flames. Hmmm, what could we do before someone spots us…"

"Just try to focus, you can think of something. We can't reach it directly with our hands or we might get lit on fire, so we need to find a stick and light it on fire. But that plan sucks. Any better ideas?"

"You say sticks? That's a great idea, I can make an ice stick and attach a match to it." - she stood still for a moment with the match box in her hands before realizing she didn't have enough arms to do this on her own. "Uhh, can you light up a match yourself and let me do the rest?"

"Sure."

Adrian lit up a couple of matches just to be safe and handed them over to Vici who embedded them into an ice stick and successfully lit up the car on fire in all key places. It took a few pairs of matches, but they eventually succeeded, put on their backpacks and hastily walked away without looking back, taking a path between the pavement and other cars to avoid detection.

"These kids are all focused on the car now. The tires popping were probably heard all the way from the lab. I don't think they're paying attention to us, thankfully, just the car. That old man is definitely judging us, though, no doubt wishing he could chase and apprehend us. Thankfully, noone else seems to be paying attention to us." - Victoria was vigilantly overanalyzing the surrounding playground nearby.

"Should we slow down now?"

"A few more steps… And… Now. I am proud of you for keeping a cool head and saving the situation. Not only do I feel amazing doing petty crime with you holding my hand, but you're also not exactly short on competence or merit."

"I don't know about that, it was you who prepared the whole thing. I am just here as an extra pair of hands, and because I love you."

"Get outta here with your attempts to sell yourself short. We've coordinated the successful attempt to light up the car perfectly together. You couldn't have done this any better. And, I love you too." - she wrapped her arm around Adrian's shoulder.

They went inside a random apartment block a decent distance away after walking in as someone was leaving, put away their masks and raincoats to throw off any potential security cameras or stalkers, then went home, texting Yulia's dad that they've successfully bought and gifted his ex-wife a toy firetruck along the way. They also bought Adrian a new dark purple coat along the way home.

The next day in school during the second break, Adrian and Vici were standing against a wall and watching a group of teenagers to their left talk about something. Adrian was projecting weird and/or loud sounds into their heads with big enough delays to confuse them and then losing it afterwards along with Victoria as his targets were getting confused and startled by their minds being violated. The range of Adrian's powers was good enough that there was no way in hell to get detected, or at least that's what they were hoping was the case. At some point, angry Yulia approached them:

"What the fuck did you do yesterday?"

"Exactly what we planned. I saw Linda being extremely sleep deprived and volatile today, so I assume we succeeded. Did we not?" - Vici asked, still recovering from laughter.

"It did, and it ruined the entire evening for her family as they watched Charlie die a slow and painful death! They tried their best to help, but he died. Why? Why are you such a monster?" - a tear was seen in her eye, but her voice didn't reflect crying.

"Whoa there. One question, was this a sting operation all along? Because you won't wanna know what we would do to your face if you don't pay us." - ice maracas appeared in Victoria's hands.

"I have the payment. I just want you to explain, why did you choose to kill her in the most agonizing way imaginable?" - by this point several people have begun watching them all converse. Linda or Fernanda were standing too far to hear or see anything.

"We got a hit on the dog, we've successfully pulled it off. Your goal was to hurt Linda, and she didn't look unharmed."

"I loved Charlie! I didn't want it to die like \*that\*!"

"Then you should have given better instructions. I am sure we would have found something which could have done the job instantaneously." - Victoria shrugged.

As she was finishing talking, someone from outside their class snuck up behind Yulia and pulled her shirt backwards and sprinted away as she was turning around and impulsively saying several swear words very loudly. Adrian did his best to contain the laughter, but only his volume has been successfully contained through covering his mouth. Vici couldn't help but to exhale, but overall kept her composure.

"Oh, you think this is funny? Using your mind control or a friend to interrupt our conversation? Ha ha fucking ha. Are you happy now?"

"It's not me, I swear." - he was still dying and it felt like the most obvious lie ever spoken, even if he never found out if Yulia believed it.

"I would recommend not tempting the wrath of Victoria by being passive aggressive to Adrian. Look, it's clear that you've made a mistake by not properly analyzing the ramifications of your actions. There's nothing more to talk about. Do you have the payment on you right now or are we going to have to burn your house to the ground?" - the switch from almost laughing at Adrian's silly prank to morbid seriousness was instant.

Instead of answering, Yulia pulled out a portable console from her backpack along with another envelope and walked away shortly after. Along with her, the small row of bystanders started quickly dispersing. Vici nodded at Adrian, and he began trying to open the envelope.

"No, not now, there's too many eyes around. I meant, can you put them into my backpack?"

Adrian smiled and complied. "Damn. I guess we just can't quite communicate telepathically yet."

"We're close enough. Maybe we could see if we could install something which would allow the two of us to telepathically communicate, that could be fun. Man, I can't believe how I reacted to her being rude to you. 'Tempt the wrath of Victoria'? Jesus, am I lame. I should really work on my threats." - she put away her ice maracas and resumed standing against a wall with Adrian.

"I heard nothing. I am more curious about why you threatened her this overtly about house burning. You wouldn't do that if you thought you could extract a contract or two from her, would you?"

"No, I wouldn't, that's another thing. I got so alarmed by her not thanking us for a job well done that I prioritized the payment over any future contracts. Fuck. She probably wouldn't have ever wanted to scam us, considering she knows it'd be suicide given her knowledge about all our powers and connections. What about the guy who snuck up on her? It was you, right?" - Vici sounded extremely frustrated.

"Yep. She was being very loud and I wanted her to shut up without saying it directly, so that was how I figured I could achieve it. He was a little confused by having his mind invaded, but I assured him that I am a friend and that I would reward him with a lot of money if he pulled her shirt backwards and then ran away when she got spooked. Did you see the look on her face?" - his eyes flashed with joy.

"I did. I loved it, masterful work. Just, please try to keep yourself together next time, even if I wasn't much better with my false positives. Well, no, at this point it's fair to say that I am entirely responsible for our failure, considering we could have easily saved it from your little prank if I properly reacted to the situation. We need to have better mental fortitude than this for us to succeed in life. But again, that was a priceless prank. Let's do more sometime."

"You're right. Also, look to the right. Are you seeing this shit?" - he noticed Yulia in the distance talking with the friends she claimed to have hated only a few days ago. Their combined body language reflected how mentally drained they all were.

"Mmm? Oh. That's fucked. I guess we've managed to repair a broken friendship so, yay us? If you can call it a friendship anymore."

"I just don't get this city. What is wrong with everyone."

"There's an upside in everything: it's easier for us to distance ourselves from these people. You'll see, your prickly subconsciousness would be a lot less unhappy about ruining these people and killing them, because they're weird and not okay in the head and not like us. The 'prickly' part came out so wrong, I am sorry."

In response, she got a hug. "Don't be. It's okay. On the bright side, we'll never have to talk to her again."

After school was over, they were having a conversation as they were approaching their home.

"I would be amazed if you manage to convince Kate to get on board with this. Jason, maybe, but Kate? You're gonna need some seriously goddamn amazing arguments for her to do something so out of character." - Adrian was thinking aloud.

"Oh, Adrian. I have ample experience in the field. Sure, it's harder when I can't lie or pressure or coerce or anything like that, she \*is\* one of us after all. But I've got ethical tools at my disposal too. You'll see." - she promised casually.

"I wonder what kind of black magic it will be this time."

"Don't know any black magic. Will probably need to visit the jail cells of a local police department to learn some, if they let us. Does that joke even work anymore?"

"Wait, what- Oooh." Adrian shrugged. "Logically, it shouldn't, considering we've been taught the values of all men being equal before the country and everything, but I don't think logic is something we can rely on in this city."

"Yea, no. What if every morning they spin a wheel for a negative trait to assign to each minority? 'Today Mexicans shall be known as thieves, Middle Asians as stoopid, and the Black as foreign spies'. Do you know anyone else I missed who I can declare as drug pushers or gangsters? Oh, hell." - her phone rang. The text which I marked with a single ' was pronounced in a very weird mix of a British and Eastern European accent. She picked up the phone and turned on the loudspeaker. "Ssup?"

"Hey, Vici. And Adrian, if he can hear me." - Kate said.

"Hi! Of course I can. You sound different. Is something wrong?" - he asked.

"It's just that I wanted to ask, was it you two who poisoned 5 dogs in an apartment block not far from where we live? I saw it on the news."

Adrian's eyes widened and he stopped in place along with Vici. "Five? Poison? No way. Did the news outlet mention the exact place where it happened?" - she asked with concern.

"It did, but I don't remember exactly. Something like Lincoln Street, 6?" - Adrian loudly and quickly inhaled and covered his mouth in shock. Victoria just made an awkward face and also stood silent for a long while trying to wrap her head around the situation. "You're both silent. Look, let's just talk this over and discuss what happened. It's not like it was intentional, right?"

Adrian sat on a rusty metal fence and started breathing deeply. "It wasn't. We were tasked with putting a ton of food trays around that area with the goal of forcing one of Yulia's former, or I guess present friends to stop and give her a window to sneak up behind the friend and beat the shit out of her." - Vici took a heavy breath. She figured she could spin the confrontation with Yulia from earlier as a performative breakup rather than a real one if Kate were to find out about it through rumors, and the genuine feeling of displeasure and frustration definitely helped. She also noticed Adrian being in stress and began comforting him with pets. "This is such a disaster. Who knew they're this fragile?"

"It's weird that you say it was a disaster. I know you wouldn't lie to me, but do you really think it is?"

"Better believe it, Kate. That was a terrible miscalculation. It's the equivalent of accidentally demolishing a school after being asked to beat up one single kid. Ugh, we should probably go clean up what's left before someone else dies."

"It's okay, sis. The neighbors could recognize you if they saw you putting down the food the day before. We all make mistakes, okay? I am just happy that you're mature enough to recognize that. And at least one of them survived." - Kate's tone became supportive again.

"Of course I am. We should probably head home. Take care and thanks for telling us."

"Have a good day! And don't beat yourself up over it."

"Can't promise that." - she hung up the call, doublechecked if she really did and began walking in circles with her hands on her temples like a stereotypical psychic. "Holy mother of shit, how didn't I know that was gonna happen? The target obviously wasn't the only dog in the area. This job went so far off the rails. Are you alright?" - Victoria stopped and faced Adrian.

"I'm good. I really hope you knew what you were doing with that alibi. There's just one thing I am confused about, how much of what you said was a lie?" - he stood up and they resumed walking. Adrian's tone of voice was residual with shock but his breathing mostly recovered.

"The part with cleaning up what's left was pure virtue signaling, and I made up our story, but I actually do feel bad about this. This isn't collateral damage anymore, it's collateral armageddon. Noone likes an assassin who leaves collateral damage. It's a good thing-"

He put his hand on her shoulder and looked at her. "Vici. Sweetie. Calm down. Look, I know it's weird for me to say this considering I've been hit with a panic attack just as I found out, and I am frankly still trying to process it, but Kate is right, we shouldn't beat ourselves up over it. It's obvious we've done something horrible, but it was also the first major crime we've ever committed. The planning didn't even take half an hour, and we're obviously still inexperienced when it comes to life in the outside world. But what I am trying to say is, we need to make mistakes to learn anything in life, and besides, the cards were clearly stacked against us, and we at least technically succeeded, even if the execution was beyond sloppy."

Victoria was alternating between looking to the opposite side and downwards. "It really is that obvious that I am blowing this out of proportion? That's probably not the right way to put it. But I am glad to have you to keep me in check. I hope I helped you with your little panic attack too. Wait, how long have we been standing in front of a door?" - she calmed down partially.

"Around 10 seconds. I thought you didn't want to interrupt your train of thought."

She unlocked the door inside the home apartment block and they went in. "No, I am just consumed by my feelings. I am not used to this mental state, it's like this city is changing me. Or you are, one of the two."

Adrian shrugged. "It's only human to feel things. Surely it beats being numb all the time?"

"It does. I just need some getting used to is all."

"Exactly. Anyway, what's our plan? Do we continue with our project?"

"Fuck to the no. We're not in a hurry, and we may aswell check out our new gaming console. Oh, sweet, we've got 10K bears for the car job well done, twice what was promised. I guess we did something right." - Vici wanted to open her phone to find something to watch later, but couldn't help but to check the notifications beforehand.

They still finished the project before the day was over.

S2E6 The Only Way To Get Ahead

Adrian, Victoria and Jason were sitting inside the same room the first two spent their free time together, waiting for Kate to arrive. She eventually did, closed the door and sat down along with everyone else. It was a weekend, so they didn't need to go to school for 2 days.

"Alright. Hit us with it. What's the big mission? Are we attacking a building full of vampires?" - Kate asked.

"Wait, full stop. What do you mean by 'vampires'?" - Vici asked.

"They're local criminals who tend to break into homes to steal people's blood for some reason."

"I can actually contribute to this conversation. Sometimes they hit blood banks and hospitals to scrape any they can find. They occasionally murder people in their homes or on raids too." - Jason added.

"I've also read reports that they sell special extra addictive drugs laced with blood. They don't have a dress code, they're just living among us somewhere."

Victoria was spinning a triangle ruler made out of ice, mesmerized by the sight. "Sounds like a fun bunch. I wonder if they're foreign saboteurs or something. Either way, the reason why we called this emergency meeting was because we're out of easy ways to earn money. Tell 'em." - she tapped Adrian's shoulder.

"Oh. Yea, we've amassed a few tens of thousands of bears and have more or less properly equipped ourselves, but we're still quite poor and we don't nearly have everything we need. We knew this could happen, so we prepared several contingency tasks we could do, and we've decided the best one we're equipped to try right now is robbing a store." - he explained.

Jason shrugged. "Sounds fun, let's do it."

Kate laughed lightly. "Whaaat? Come on, guys. You know I would never agree to this."

"It's in your best interest to agree, sis. You know the biggest items on our grocery list are meant for you. A gun, the training required to use it, or maybe some overpriced garbage that would catch our eye: they all cost mountains. The rest of us are easier to satisfy." - Victoria argued.

"I am getting tired of you mocking my tastes. Please, stop." - it was clear how uncomfortable saying this felt for her.

"I'm sorry, I'll stop. What about the rest?"

"I know what you're playing at, Vici. The thing is, it's really not crucial for me to get a pistol as soon as possible, you know. I would love to get to action, yes, but I have \*some\* patience. I'll be fine."

"You might be, but I doubt you could say the same for everyone else. There's plenty of crime out there, I mean, if our school is the way it is, imagine how bad the rest of the city is. These people need you as soon as possible. "

"Why do you care about the common citizen all of a sudden?" - Kate squinted at Vici.

"I don't, but I know you do, and I am trying to make you realize that you want this most of everyone. And what do you think is gonna go wrong for the ones we robbed if we succeed? Do you really think the employees of our target store won't be able to explain to their superiors that they were completely overrun by 4 people with superior equipment? They'll be fine, they'll get a slap on the wrist and continue on with their lives, and it's not like losing, I don't know, 100K is a big deal to them. Sometimes you have to make little sacrifices in life to prioritize what's important, but this is barely even a sacrifice. It's just straight up free money with no strings attached."

Kate looked away and thought for a moment. "I can't believe you... Well, I can. It's completely in character. So let's say I agree. Why are you saying there aren't any strings attached, considering we've never done anything like this and we're very likely to get physically overpowered and caught?" - as Kate was talking, Victoria stealthily winked at Adrian, to which he approvingly nodded.

"Because we're not. Our target is a small convenience store with only around 4 employees or something around that. Most of them would be locked inside a staff room, and the 2 cashiers would be powerless to resist all 4 of us. The nearest police department is a decent distance away so they would never be able to reach us before we grab all we need and slip away." - she showed the target store on the satellite maps. There were a ton of other shops nearby and it looked like there were plenty of routes to safely escape.

"You don't just expect to march there in our usual clothes and hope there aren't cameras around to recognize us?"

"No, we've got 4 raincoats and 4 medical masks. Our faces would be fully hidden."

"And what if the cashiers wouldn't be the only people who could reach us in the store? What if the employees in the staff room manage to break out? I would have thought you took into account that things could go wrong and that you have to be prepared. We all know the trope, the drug deals and robberies and shit never go perfectly because it wouldn't be fun to watch otherwise, unless the point is to subvert the expectations of the consumer of such content."

"Of course we know." - Adrian shrugged.

"And of course we've prepared for shit going wrong, which is why we've prepared quite thoroughly despite our speed. Go ahead, Adrian." - Vici requested, to which he pulled out 3 serrated ice longswords from underneath a pillow. It was hard to get a hold of them properly with only 2 hands, but Adrian eventually managed to get to hold them up.

"You don't seriously expect us to rob a store in 2090 with just swords and our completely non lethal powers, right?" - Kate asked, confused.

"Correct, that's not all. You're gonna love this one." - she took a non-transparent food container from behind herself and opened it after placing it on her knees. Inside was a pistol made of ice, which she took in her free hand and showed from different sides. "Beautiful, isn't she?"

"That's very pretty. But um, why does the safety look so weird? One near the handle and one on top right?"

"This? It's the second trigger, in case the first one gets jammed. Is that not how it works?"

Kate wheezed. Adrian and Victoria looked at eachother awkwardly, both thinking "We fucked up", just in slightly different words. "My god. Ignoring the fact that someone might easily figure out that a gun made out of ice doesn't actually have any gunpowder to launch bullets with, that lever doesn't nearly look the same as a trigger, and it's there to prevent yourself from accidentally shooting yourself in the leg." - Kate's voice abruptly shifted to a higher pitch. "And why is there a second bullet hole? Where have you seen a double-barrel pistol, especially with the barrels positioned vertically? Come on." - she was laughing too hard to say anything more. Everyone else couldn't help but smile, except Jason who was browsing something in his phone before and looking around to try to understand what's going on.

"We considered making this with you, but we also wanted to surprise you with the end result and it didn't seem like it would be this bad." - Adrian noted in an embarrassed tone.

"Oh, no, you got me all wrong. I might be laughing at it and its details, but that's the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life. Even though it's not a gun, it resembles one and that's enough to please my eyes. Stunning looks aside, let's make it more life-accurate before we head out. Should only take like 15 minutes."

"Alright. Boys, I hate to say it, but it's probably best if you hang out together for a bit while we're doing this so we're done sooner." - Vici requested.

Jason was quickly on his way out, still silently browsing something on his phone. "We'll be fine. Have fun, you two. I'd love to see the end result." - Adrian gave her a quick hug and also left.

He decided to lie on his parents' made bed and look for something to watch as Jason went to get some food.

\*or was it not his parents, needs verification to avoid continuity error\*

By the time he found a history video about the last US president to watch, Jason came back with a large container full of unpeeled apple slices and laid next to him. Didn't look like the container was originally sold with these apples, but it wasn't possible to verify with the marking being gone.

"Never took you for someone with a giant stomach. Unless you want to share some." - Adrian admitted, pausing the video.

"That wasn't the plan, but feel free to eat as many as you need. I've bought tons." - Jason didn't hesitate to immediately start eating. After a few seconds, Adrian joined in too.

"Why apples, specifically, and why that many? Isn't it better to eat a variety of food?"

"That's true, but apples are sweet, juicy, filling and cheap. It's the perfect filler food."

"You might be onto something, these are amazing. Are these natural? They sure taste like it."

"Nope, all synth."

"That's incredible. Anyway, how's things?"

"They certainly could be better. I am glad to be invited to a major job with you three, but I really wish we could hang out beyond that. Like right now."

"Oh…" - it took Adrian a moment to think it over. "What about Kate? Is something wrong with her?"

"Yes, she is pissed at me. Can't say why exactly."

"That's okay, it's more interesting if you don't say that anyway. Leaves me with plenty of room to speculate on my own about what it was. Maybe you sold drugs to a first grader, or tried to start a fire in the school. Or what if you managed to trap someone on a tree with no way down? Vici could probably think of something even wilder." - Adrian said, smiling.

"Haha. Yea." - the awkwardness was written all over Jason's voice, but Adrian just assumed he was just sad or ashamed.

He then clapped Jason's shoulder twice. "Still, don't beat yourself up for it. Both me and Vici have pissed off Kate before, that's just the kind of person she is. You'll make up eventually."

"I really hope so. I still wish \*we\* could spend more time together."

Adrian took a few seconds to finish chewing. "Me too. But me and Vici are busy working half the time and busy spending our free time together for the rest of it. We could probably watch something with just 3 of us, but when we do that with Kate, it gets overwhelming at times."

"Overwhelming? I thought you all had an amazing dynamic between one another."

"Of course we do, and I love spending time with her, but she is \*hyper\*. It's not bad on its own, but every time she is around Vici, Vici gets the same kind of hyper. It's like she changes her brain frequency to resonate with Kate properly, and that's the overwhelming part. Again, they're extremely fun that way, even if I can't quite keep up, but spending time with them for long enough when they're together is too much for my head. I don't know how to explain it, it's like a mix of my ears and my brain getting overloaded."

Jason turned his head away sadly. "That's really unfortunate."

"We still care about you, though. At least me and Vici. She treats people she considers business partners or henchmen or pawns very differently from how she treats you, even if you don't know eachother all too well. I am sure Kate cares too, in her own way. And I just straight up like you."

"I am really happy to hear that. Thank you so much for inviting me here, even if four is a crowd."

"No problem! And hey, maybe you can find some active friends in school or somewhere else. Sure, we literally live together, but I also get the desire to just sit next to someone and watch random stupid videos about whatever the algorithm suggests in your freetime. Speaking of, wanna see a video about the history of the last US president?"

"Not big into history, but sure."

After the group ventured out towards their target later, all dressed up in raincoats, cleaning gloves and medical masks with holes to the sides, they were seen laughing about something. Kate and Adrian were laughing loudly, the rest - less so.

"One last score, Kate, and we got enough money to leave. Not sure where, but we'll figure out that part later." - Adrian said.

"Pärnu, Adrian. Nightclubs, beaches, cargo ships and some of the best gosh darn electronic plants in the country." - Kate explained. They were all speaking in heavy cowboy accents, but Kate's one was the heaviest and the most lifelike out of all of them.

"Porno is a real weird name for a town, partner." - Victoria commented. Her accent wasn't as heavy, but it was still believable.

"Ts'all real, cowpoke. It's in the Baltics. That area became everyone's favorite after Crimea and Sochi got turned into uninhabitable darn hellholes."

"Well ain't that fascinatin'."

"This is it, cowboys! One last time! Hyaa!"

"The law ain't gon get us! Hyaa!" - Jason added.

Everyone else joined in with their hyaa's before beginning to gallop across the streets like horses.

After arriving to the target store with a giant purple sign of "Rocket" with a logo of a cartoonishly thick rocket in orbit, 3 out of 4 of them leaned against a wall while Victoria went to do a circle around the building. After coming back to the front after a minute, she asked:

"I am finished. Gang, what's your sigma?"

"What do you mean 'what's your sigma'? The fuck does that even mean, V?" - K asked and laughed. And yes, they switched to using the first letters of their names instead of real names.

"Depends on the context, K. V, it's all empty besides the 2 cashiers. We're ready when you are." - codename A answered.

"Alright. Everyone ready?" - V asked.

"I need to check my delta first." - K japed.

"Shut up, K, or I'll hit you with a prime alpha." - V's tone of voice remained focused while clearly indicating banter.

"I need to go to the bathroom." - J said.

"Stop making funny jokes, this is serious." - V said, doing her best to remain focused.

"I really need to. Number two."

A wheezed and K covered her mouth. "Alright, fuck this. We're doing this, cowboys. Let's go."

They entered the store. V quietly locked the entrance with ice, walked to the staff room and locked it too. The rest started looking around, some thinking what should they steal, some pretending to think what should they buy, not that there was any way to tell, not even who was who. After V was done locking the staff door, she beckoned the posse to the counter before quickly drawing her new revised ice pistol at the empty-faced cashiers and turning off the "safety". The fake pistol had a believable-looking silencer this time. The rest drew their ice swords and pointed them at the cashiers too.

"Lady and gentleman, this is a hold up. Hands in the air and step outside the counter, come on. We don't have all day."

One cashier shrugged, the other sighed, both of them complied. The robbers kept a good distance away from the cashiers to avoid "Aren't you kids a little young to be committing felonies?" - the male one asked.

"Aren't you a little old to be stupid? It only takes one good stab to the belly to send you on a date with Jesus, so you better shut up and do what we say." - A ordered, full of adrenaline.

"Guys, we missed someone! Look!" - K alarmed everyone and pointed her free hand at a late middle-aged man with a focused expression staring at everyone from across the shop. Some pounding along with unintelligible speech has been heard from the staff room door and lasted around 40 seconds.

"Stay frosty or we'll kill all of you. Not a move." - V ordered. The stranger silently started walking towards the group. "Prepare to stab the cashiers if they make any sudden movements, y'all. I've got the hero." - she began approaching the hero in question before J levitated him into the air.

"Huh? What the-" - the man asked in panic.

"Good job, J."

As the robbers quickly handcuffed the hostages and placed them against a shelf, A was busy looking for the key to unlock each cash register and then stuffing his pockets with all the money inside.

"There's fuck all money here, V! There's only like 6 to 8 thousand in total."

"In both cash registers?" - she asked.

"Yes."

V approached the hostages with a newly assembled ice dagger, but stopped when the cashiers started talking. "The day has barely even started, of course we don't have much. The safe money was collected just 2 days ago also, there's not much more there." - the male one explained.

"You're walking us there or I am cutting off your eyes. Choose wisely." - V asked.

"Let's get this over with."

V freed the cashier and gestured him to move towards the staff room with her head, the ice pistol aimed at him. "J, you're coming with me. Stay behind us. The rest of you, guard the hostages and don't hesitate to kill them if they even breathe the wrong way."

"Are we… fine to do that?" - K asked.

"Yes. Just if you're killing them, kill them fast so they don't scream much. We'll be fine." - her tone was tense, yet composed.

After K, J and the male cashier went away, K commented:

"I am starting to doubt this was a good idea."

"Anxious that we should have been gone 3 times over by now? Yea, same." - A was moderately hyperventilating.

"That too, but even if we get away, which I doubt we will, considering everyone who passed by probably noticed the commotion inside, this just feels bad. I shouldn't be doing this."

"It's never too late to free us and redeem yourself. We'll put a good word for you two to the police." - the remaining cashier promised.

A kicked her in the knees. She didn't even flinch. "Shut up, adults are talking. Look, K, I can feel that you're struggling to process what's happening, but remember: this is for the greater good. We're doing what must be done."

"That doesn't-" - the customer hostage from earlier began.

"One more sound from you and the cops would have to clean up what's left of you from the floor. You think I can't do that? I can, and I will. You won't be so tough when I split you in two. Hundred. Try me." - A moved closer to him and made a small puncture on the hostage's upper lip with the tip of his sword. He was bluffing, he just didn't want either of them to say anything which would get K to change her mind. The customer just frowned at him and silence took over the room.

"Whoa, stay where you are there, cowboy. You can't leave, I've locked the door from the other side. Not one move, or I'll shoot both of ya. J, do the thing. Good, now cut off his left thumb for being stupid." - V's extra fast voice from the other room was heard.

"Please, no!" - a hispanic accent pleaded.

"Okay, but only because you asked nicely. On the ground, and hands behind your back. Go on."

After around a minute of looting the safe, V beckoned A and K to the staff room and everyone escaped through the back door and started quickly walking away (but not sprinting) through random streets and alleys in chaotic patterns.

"I think we're clear, baby! We did it!" - Adrian celebrated by joyfully jumping in the air.

"We won! We handled that so well. We probably can't actually tell if we did until a few days later, but we might just have gotten away with it. Oh, I have never been happier in my entire life. The air has never felt sweeter, the oxygen is intoxicating." - Vici also celebrated. She was talking noticeably faster than usual. "You carried the job, J. I don't know if it's safe to use real names yet. Good job."

"I am glad you think so, that was a ton of fun!" - Jason replied, although less drunk on adrenaline than Adrian or Victoria.

"You probably didn't hear it, but I kicked the remaining cashier and told her to shut up because 'the adults are talking'! I can't believe I said that to someone. I feel strong enough to lift a mountain!" - Adrian bragged.

"Hell yea. You showed them. \*We\* showed them. What about you, Kate? You're barely saying anything." - Vici asked.

"Oh, I was just thinking. I didn't expect this to be so brutal. I know we barely even harmed anyone, but I feel like a bully. I know it was crucial for us to do it and everyone is better off this way, but I keep seeing their exhausted, harmless faces. Did you ever feel this way too?"

"Of course I did. But here's what I told Adrian already which you should also know: learn to suppress that gut feeling which tells you to hit the brakes. It's there to prevent you from achieving true greatness. You're not a bully, you're a queen. They simply deserve less than you and are morally inferior to you, and in every other way too, so take what you deserve by force and suppress all remorse. Embrace your true nature, don't push it away. I think I see a bank in the distance." - Vici got back to the euphoric tone. "We could absolutely hit it and get a million bears. We've already got a ton, but with that kind of money, we'll have infinite room to do whatever we want! We could start a charity to help homeless kids, we could buy all the games we want, we could do \*anything\*."

"Yes! Yes! Let's do this!" - Adrian seconded.

"This sounds quite a bit riskier, but if you think we have a good chance, I am also down. Let's hit it!" - Jason thirded.

Kate sighed. "I don't know what to say, or what to do. Just, lead the way, sister. I hope it will be over faster that way." - she expressed emptily.

"That's also a valid approach. Cease thinking and just do it, and by the time we're done, you'll know you did the right thing. Do what you have to do, Kate. I am always here to support you."

\*and then they go in, there's more people inside, but they manage to get the hostages to fawn with some difficulties\*

"Now, you there. Open the door before I shoot someone. Most of these people have families, you know, they'd be really sad if I did." - V ordered one of the bank staff members behind bulletproof glass. The target complied, opening the iron gate and going back to holding his hands in the air with a bored expression. "I got the customers, J and K, you got the staff, A has the vault." - the crew members complied.

"Which way to the vault?" - A asked.

"It's in the basement right over there." - a different staff member asked.

"Anyone in there?"

"No. Not that you'll get it open."

"I'll be the judge of that."

"No, that's not how that's gonna go. You are going to accompany him and open the door to the vault so we can all go home." - V ordered.

"We physically can't help you. There's an excessive amount of anti-robbery systems designed to keep guys like you from ever accessing the vault. We have externally monitored cameras, a time lock, I could list them all day. Save yourself some energy and cut your losses." - a third man managing the counters suggested.

"Bullshit. We're going down there." - A ordered.

"Hold on. Is a time lock what I think it is?" - V asked.

"It disallows anyone to access the vault at noon, yes. And no, it costs no additional money. I am not bluffing: we can go down there and I could show you right now."

Before he even finished speaking, a loud voice with minor artifacts was heard from outside the bank. "Alright, fun time's over, kids. Surrender yourselves and do not harm any hostages. You can't run and you can't hide."

"Don't think we won't shoot you just because the cops are here. Stay down or we'll put you down. We should look for side exits, maybe we'll be able to slip past them unnoticed. Do you guys see anything which looks like a way out?" - V asked, slightly more tense than usual, but still composed.

"We might be cooked here, V. I don't see a way out. I don't think we can go through the front door, either." - K noted sadly.

"Relax, K, we haven't lost yet. They don't know who we are, and if we run away and scatter, they won't be able to get all of us."

"You know we can see and hear you through the security cameras, right? And there isn't exactly an abundance of people who use ice weapons. Come on, give it up. You would be further betraying your country by fighting till the last breath here." - a different loud voice from the outside spoke, feminine this time.

"Fuck."

"That's our mom! What is she doing here? We're fucked, aren't we?" - Jason asked.

Every child in the gang stepped outside the staff zone into the lobby and congregated near Victoria. "There's gotta be something we could do. I know there's a better approach than just surrendering right now, but I can't think straight. Any ideas?"

"I don't think you ever think \*straight\*." - Adrian was still audibly tense, even if his words didn't reflect it.

"What do you- Damn it, Adrian, not now. Well, no, actually, that's exactly what I do need right now. Your stupid jokes. The good kinda stupid."

"Kate, what the fuck are they on about?" - Jason asked, confused.

Kate just shrugged without even looking at anyone. "I don't see how we're getting out of this free of trouble. Would you hate me if I left and surrendered right now?" - she asked.

"No. But make sure you know what you're doing. If there's a better way, you ending this the simple way might backfire for the rest of us." - Vici explained.

"I just…" - Kate sighed and sat against a wall. "I really hate to ask, Jason, but can I get a sip of that weird cola you shoplifted?" - gulps were heard from behind Adrian and Victoria.

"Cola? I want some cola first. Jason, what the hell are you doing? That's not cola." - she turned around halfway through, still pointing the fake ice pistol at hostages, and witnessed Jason drinking from a tall, black bottle.

He stopped drinking and clutched his throat with his free hand. "Oh shit… It burns so much… Aw… Does anyone have any water?" - he mumbled, interrupted by coughing.

Adrian approached him to put a hand on his shoulder and take a look at what was going on. Jason's face looked like he was getting slowly impaled by a pike. "I don't, but I've borrowed some smoked cheese. Would that help?" - his tone changed to reflect the worry in his voice.

"Gimme…" - Adrian complied, pulling out the stolen smoked cheese and giving Jason all of it aside from a small strip which he couldn't help but to eat himself.

"Why did you gulp half a bottle of red wine like water? This isn't critical enough for us to kill ourselves. What were you thinking?" - Vici asked, frustrated, eyes still on the hostages.

"Wanted to see… What would… Happen…"

"Jeez. What happened to normal kid desires of visiting a theme park or building a snowman and not, I don't know, drinking enough wine to get you instantly hammered? Maybe you'll be fine. I've seen teens slurp beer in quiet places like water."

"He's an 11 year old who never tasted alcohol before. I am afraid he won't get 'hammered' but rather dead from that much alcohol. We have legal drinking age laws for a reason. He needs immediate hospitalization or he's dead in 3 hours. If you let us in, we'll get him there and save his life. We don't have much time to spare. No, Arizonov, we can't interrogate him immediately, he will fucking die. His life is worth 100 times as much as yours is, so do what you're told and we won't take a week of PTO from you." - a different voice promised over the megaphone before switching to a more impatient and frustrated tone. Jason was gagging and coughing while the speech was ongoing.

"Turn off the loudspeaker, the whole city can hear you." - his partner said emotionlessly.

"What are you talking about? I pressed the-"

"That's my dad's voice." - Kate observed, still sitting on the ground.

"Him too? I admire your dad's confidence. Only a few days in the force, if not just one, and already talking to his coworkers like he owns them. Talk about self-esteem." - a great deal of tension was lifted from Victoria's tone.

"So, is it over?" - Adrian asked.

"Yep, it's over. It's a shame, it was going so sweet." - they all went for the exit.

"Sorry for the trouble! I hope we didn't waste too much of your day." - he told the hostages as they were standing up. Victoria noticed it too, but didn't say anything and just kept walking towards the exit.

The police drove Vici, Adrian and Kate to a police station, all 3 in the back of one car. As per their requests, the first two got a shared cell, while Kate got one of her own. Jason was carried into a different car which went the other way after the arrests.

"Why did we even need handcuffs, since we aren't actually going to juvie and since it's not in our best interest to resist?" - Adrian asked as his ones were being removed after he's been brought into his cell. Nothing from the outside world was visible from said cell, but at least the top of the cell had an old dessturated yellow ceiling lamp, which was flickering from time to time and clearly not running at full strength. Him and Vici were wearing their normal clothes by this point.

"Protocol. And to prevent you from doing something stupid again."

"He's got a point. I wouldn't trust me either after what happened." - Victoria admitted.

"We'll see you in an hour and a half, as we agreed. Try to calm down and think the whole situation over."

"Yea, yea, we know."

Adrian plopped on the dirty bed in the cell as the cops were leaving before positioning himself to lie on his back, staring at the ceiling. "Ow. Not the best bed I've ever laid on."

"Not the best performance we've had today, either. I don't know how did all 4 of us not think that robbing a bank with zero prep was a stupid idea. And the worst part is? The idea was all mine." - she was walking around the cell in circles.

"I assumed you knew what you were getting us into. I mean, who could have thought that banks have 100 times more security to compensate for having 100 times more money?" - he knew that wasn't nearly accurate, but it sounded better this way.

"It's probably completely impossible to hit a bank in general without someone on the inside, at least a bank that size. Or without somehow digging around the vault door right inside the vault either quickly enough for noone to be able to respond in time or quietly enough for anyone to notice until it's too late. All of which we are too broke to do. I guess I was too high on our successful store robbery and my inner megalomaniac has decided it's her time to shine."

"I mean, is being a megalomaniac really so bad? You said it, we deserve power and money more than anyone."

"That's not the bad part. It's the blindness it caused me which is problematic. I am not saying it's time to hold our horses and be like the puny little people, of course it's not, and it never will be. We'll just need to be less stupid is all."

"Hopefully whatever next you got in store for us is a bit less complicated."

"Look at me for a moment." - she faced him and made a head shake in the direction of a camera recording the cell. "We might have to get into fishing or get into mining like in the good ol' days of 1848. But we'll figure something out, as long as we stick together." - the first sentence was said with fingers crossed, the second - with the entire hand spread out.

After the time was up, Kate was brought into the cell by 2 police officers, her dad being one of them. The other cop carried a camping chair, and both of them carried an A5 paper sheet. Adrian and Vici were watching something on one of their phones.

"Welcome, wary travellers. If you've got coin, Ad'Rian has wares." - Adrian said in a weird accent, pronouncing his name extra weirdly.

"Whaddaya sellin'?" - Kate asked back, her mood back to normal.

He turned off his phone and began preparing to get off the bed. "No no no, stay on the bed. It's best if we do this right here." - the other officer said as he was putting down a camping chair near the wall opposite of the bed and taking a seat on it with his A5 sheet of paper.

"Wait. Could I always use my phone in my cell? I thought you just forgot to take it." - Kate asked, sitting down on the bed next to her friends.

"Of course you could, Kate. If you tried to contact an accomplice, we would have been alerted right away." - her dad explained, leaning against a wall.

"Fuck. That would have saved me so much boredom." - Victoria tried to spook her by putting her erratically moving left hand against her face. "Ah!" - she giggled lightly.

"No more boredom for you. Only terror." - Vici noted, smiling.

"Are you three ready to get to it?" - the officer on the foldable chair asked impatiently.

Adrian nodded, Victoria said "Sure", and Kate gave a thumbs up.

"You've committed an impressive list of crimes in those few hours. 2 counts of armed robberies, 4 counts of false imprisonments, 2 counts of aggravated assaults, one more with a deadly weapon, burglary, possession of a replica firearm, criminal misuse of bladed weapons, grand larceny, retail theft, which means shoplifting by the way, criminal mischief, unauthorized concealment of identity, obstruction of justice, violation of public safety, consumption and possession of alcohol by a minor and resisting arrest. And we're also not sure you were allowed to manufacture these swords, given their nature, but this would be more than enough to warrant you the death penalty under normal circumstances, despite your age."

\*adjust after writing the first part of the bank section properly\*

"Is it wrong that this makes me proud?" - Adrian asked. All 3 children had their own "that's bullshit" parts of the list, but nobody said a thing, even though Kate had a lot of things to say.

Despite her best efforts to keep it together, Victoria couldn't contain the giggle, which caused Adrian to laugh too through a chain reaction. Kate just stared at them judgmentally. "Talk about reading the room." - Vici said quietly, still grappling with how hilariously out of place that comment was.

The cop on the camping chair rolled his eyes. "She's not wrong, Adrian, this is serious. This country has done so much for you, granted you all these powers, all this freedom, let alone created you in the first place. We're doing the best we can to keep you happy, it's really disheartening to see you steal from it instead of paying anything back." - Kate's dad said.

Victoria took a few seconds to recover and raised a stop hand. "Listen. We're kids, and we need fun. Despite how great it is not to be in the lab anymore, this is still very stressful. Is it really so bad if we screwed around just a little to relieve stress? It's not like we caused a lot of damage or anything."

"We actually-" - Kate tried to say something before getting interrupted.

"Kate. Kate. Not now."

"I find it difficult to believe that someone as smart and merited as yourself would ever genuinely say something like this, Victoria. Tell us the truth, we won't bite." - Kate's dad promised.

"One day the tomfoolery defense will work on someone, I just know it."

"What you also need to realize is that you're putting yourselves in danger too. You flash your powers like you've got nothing to fear, well you do. Most people have no idea you're replicants and that not all of your powers come from cybernetics, and all that lifting people up in the air, using ice weapons which don't melt in room temperature? We'll do our best to censor any news and mentions about you having powers beyond what money can buy, but the rumors will spread, you will gain heat, and some will kill you and try to harvest you, even if they can't."

"Well that sucks. Thanks for alarming us."

"I am gonna speak for myself now. Out of all 4 of us, I was the one who agreed the last, which I guess is irrelevant considering we're all in this together. I was confident that in order for me to receive a pistol plus the training required to use it as fast as possible and get to saving this city from crime, I needed to do some bad things for good reasons, and I frankly don't regret it, despite how wrong it felt. However, I definitely should have bailed on the bank job, but it was easier to follow through than to use my head and quit while I was ahead." - Kate explained sadly, but less so than before the arrest.

"Why didn't you ask me and Mom for help? We would have found you some way of getting the money needed, or even covered the costs. Then there's the paradox of doing crime to fight crime, and I don't just mean the robberies themselves, but vigilanteism itself is also a crime, and a serious one at that." - her dad responded.

She made an awkward face. "Drat."

"Never heard that one before." - Adrian noted.

"We have a theory on why you did this, and it perfectly matches with your responses and being complete menaces within an already notoriously chaotic and lawless school. One of you more than the rest." - the officer on the chair looked at Vici. She responded with an extra sassy shrug. "You just needed some work to keep yourselves busy. So here's the brutal truth: police in this city are severely understaffed. We don't have enough resources to do our jobs, our vacation time gets cut and our work hours get inflated to compensate so we don't have the energy to do our jobs properly, and the same vicious unending cycle has been going for way too long."

"Excuses, excuses. Get to the point." - his partner ordered coldly.

"Yes, sir. As you know, we're fighting two wars, and manpower gets diverted from domestic security towards making progress in them. See the problem?"

"Two wars? I thought we were only in a war against whatever Turkey calls itself nowadays." - Victoria asked.

"It's Terkayö, not that anyone cares, and yes, we're at war with Turkmenistan too. We can tell you about that later." - the standing cop explained.

"Are they not the same?"

"No, but they may as well be. Good people, evil governments."

"What we're saying is, we should have offered you to help us earlier, but it's not too late to absolve yourselves by agreeing to it now. You won't need to do anything mundane, we need someone to help us in investigations, sting operations, managing and maintaining surveillance equipment. We might even let you participate in emergency responses, bodyguarding VIP's or even raids if you prove strong and competent enough. There's all kinds of work to do of varying difficulty and risk." - the other one offered cheerfully.

Kate made an exhale of joy mid offer. "I hope you're not expecting us to be paid in experience alone." - Vici said.

"Of course not. Even a fraction of what we're being paid will be more than enough for you, and your paychecks would only grow as you get better and more experienced. It might not be as profitable or easy as weekly robberies, but it won't be long before you have more money than you know what to do with."

"This is perfect." - Kate said.

"We really should have just asked from the beginning. Assuming this is legit." - Adrian added.

"We'll see. It's definitely worth a try. And if you don't count me out of interrogations, you'll never have to worry about them going wrong ever again." - Victoria boasted.

"Respectfully, despite your abilities, I don't think you're threatening or experienced enough to help with that, even if these do take up a considerable amount of time." - Kate's dad doubted.

"Wanna bet on that? I might be short, and my voice isn't exactly threatening, but they won't be able to resist if I put on a mask of a psychotic, murder-happy maniac who can control ice and make a few bluffs about my hands being untied. If anything, I could weaponize my age to coerce them into confessions more efficiently."

"That's good, but interrogations don't always involve coercion. They usually do, but sometimes a friendly approach works best. Sitting down with the criminal for hours, asking them to tell the story over and over again, fighting a battle of patience."

"I could probably do that in theory, but I sure as shit wouldn't like to right now. But you said it: they \*usually\* do involve coercion. You'd think people around here would be a little less susceptible to being covered in ice than in the boiling cauldron we used to live in, but they aren't. They won't resist the temptation to spill their guts right out." - Kate turned her face away.

The officers looked at eachother in relief. "You'll fit right in around here, young lady." - the one on the chair commented with approval.

After a few hours of detailed explanations of what happened before and during the robberies aswell as discussing the details of their support of the police, Kate left to enjoy the rest of her saturday. Her friends stayed, and Vici was given an opportunity to demonstrate her skills while Adrian and Kate's dad watched through a one way window.

When Victoria entered a torture room filled with unusual headsets, a professional sound system, weird torture tools which looked custom-made, and more. In the corner, a male prisoner around 35 years old in underwear was standing, restrained against a wall. He was slightly overweight. "Are you lost?" - he sounded bored and strained.

"Oh no, I'm alright. Just wanted to introduce myself. I looooove meeting new people, it's always so exciting and exhilarating. Wanna know why?" - she faked a euphoric mood and maniacal personality. Victoria approached the target, made the biggest smile she physically could and whispered, "It's refreshing to listen to screams I've never heard before" before beginning to quickly cover the target with ice taken from a giant ice ball with a handle, top to bottom.

As he screamed from pain, Adrian commented from outside the chamber to Kate's dad:

"Told you she's good."

"She barely even started yet, it's too early to say."

Meanwhile, as Vici was finishing up the rest of him, she said, faking a twisted artistic trance:

"Oh, yes, scream for me, big man. The loud, high notes of your voice, music to my ears. Please, please don't confess to anything, so we can have some fun for as long as we can before your body succumbs to frostbite." - he tried to say something, but the pain was too great. Vici waltzed around the room awkwardly, trying her best to fake euphoria. "Oh, how I'll miss you and your song of anguish. You've given me the best scream I've heard in a while, maybe ever. Just keep silent and don't say anything, so we can both enjoy this moment for a little while longer."

"Please… I did it… Stop…" - he mumbled quietly.

She started slowly removing ice. "Awww, you're breaking my heart. My job unfortunately obligates me to ask you what you did exactly, but it would please me if you answered slowly and with a lot of useless information. Just a bit more basking in your pain, oh please."

"Ugh… I sent my dick pic to my deceased friend so I could save up on buying an online storage subscription… I urgently needed to hard reset my phone…"

"Yes, good, tell me the little things, like distribution of porn or sexual harassment or whatever they'll count this as, before confessing to the big thing. I am so glad you feel the same way about spending time with me."

"I sold the vampires the locations of newcomers into the city… They wanted it to have a list of easy targets for blood theft… Oh god, please, stop… That's all…"

"Oh no. I am being ordered to take off the ice and leave you alone. Well, I suppose we've had a good run, you and I. I sure hope this isn't the last time we meet, it's been very nice to get to know you." - she removed the ice and left the room. She wasn't roleplaying this time: she was told by Kate's dad over the radio that the task was complete.

Vici shut the door to the torture chamber. "Easy. Barely even prepared in advance. And now he belongs to the Motherland, just like us." - she said with zero emotion both in her voice and on her face.

"Are you mocking your country, Victoria?"

"Oh come on, what part of that is mockery?" - Adrian asked.

Vici nodded. "I am just saying, he is now forced to make a choice between working for you in prison or fighting for you on the battlefield. You won. He's yours."

"Okay. You also don't really belong to the Motherland, you know. You're not slaves, and you're free to live your lives as you please." - the officer reassured.

"No, we're not. You guys wouldn't just let us go. What if we preferred drawing and gaming like normal kids instead?" - Vici still had conflicting, unaddressed feelings about the prospect of a real battlefield. She didn't care to think them over any time soon.

"That was the original point of the lab, actually, to raise you to love combat. We've yet to meet anyone in that entire lab who complained about their destiny, not counting kids under 5. It's all designed to make your lives fulfilling and fun at the end of the day. But I digress, you did an amazing job in there. He folded super quickly. You may have overacted here and could have presented yourself with higher instability, but it's great for a persona you've made up on the spot. We'll send you a bonus of 300 bears."

"Wow, we REALLY should have started with this." - Adrian noted happily.

"The regular payments we've agreed on are quite a bit more modest, it's just some positive reinforcement to make it extra clear to us that we're doing the right thing. Thanks nonetheless." - Victoria said contently.

"Of course. I'd test your skills further today, but your friends are arriving in town today's evening and I am sure you're eager to see them again, so unless you have more crimes planned, you're free to go." - Kate's dad started leading the duo towards the exit.

"What is he talking about?" - Adrian asked.

"It's the next batch from the lab. I guess it's been enough time. Before we go, mind if I ask one more question?" - Vici asked.

"You just did." - the officer answered dryly.

"Heard that one before. What's the situation with racism in the force here?"

He looked around to make sure noone could hear them, then stopped and turned around. "It's heavily discouraged, of course. However, they just can't afford to just fire anyone who murders a minority, so they have to punish the offenders with work hour hikes or pay cuts, sometimes with just imaginary strikes that don't do much. It's not pretty, but there's no better option. Some realize this and thread the fine line of 'having fun' and not becoming a nuisance, and there's nothing to be done about them. Don't expect the same kind of leniency towards yourselves, though. We're already letting you get away with too much." - he said, muffling his voice.

Vici shrugged. "Knew it."

"Wait, how do you have so much insight, again?" - Adrian asked.

"I'm a part of the military, Adrian. Mind of Liberty Branch. You'll learn more at school later, but law enforcement is under the control of both the President and the Omnislavian Ministry of Peace, to simplify. Of course I have insight, and influence." - Kate's dad answered outloud.

The duo left the building, holding hands as always. Their raincoats have been confiscated for further analysis, the swords used in the robbery have been melted away with Kate's dad's consent and the hilts of said swords were returned back to Victoria who found a place to stash them in one of her pockets. Adrian asked:

"Do you actually feel good about this or were you just pretending?"

"Well, no. It felt weird and out of my comfort zone, even if I could probably get used to it eventually. Unless you meant becoming sort of paid interns, sort of contractors for the police, whatever the fuck are we now." - Adrian nodded. "Oh, of course I'm happy about \*that\*. Sure, being fined by 10K sucks, but it's stable, plentiful income, we can still do some of the other schemes we had planned to earn even more, \*and\* we get to brutally oppress the common citizen in the name of justice. I am amazed Kate didn't nope the fuck out, honestly. She still might."

"She could somehow accept it and roll with it. She did that with the heists, she could get nudged towards a reason to do that here too."

"I guess we'll see. I still can't get over how you said you were proud of how long was our list of crimes. It's not like I wasn't, but you just said it to their faces with negative fear. For fuck's sake." - she giggled lightly.

Adrian smiled. "I'm sorry. I'll try not to say stupid shit in serious situations."

"Stupid doesn't imply it won't help the situation, but yea, you get the point. I'm still proud of you for having the balls to say that, even if it was stupid. You never get old."

"Even when you scold me, you just can't help but to do so in the most affectionate way possible." - Adrian noted serenely.

"You're right. And that just won't do, so let's balance it out." - Vici pinched his arm.

"No! Not again!" - but more of them followed, targeting various exposed parts of the skin. "Ahh! Help! Well, it doesn't actually hurt that much anymore."

"Is that a challenge?" - she asked with a large smile, pausing the pinches for suspense. The smile was natural this time.

"No. No." - Adrian took a few steps back, full of joy and mild fear, although it was impossible to tell if the fear was serious or ironic.

Several hours later, Victoria was sitting on a bench inside a railway station, crown back on her head, watching something. Eventually, she noticed a group of some soldiers, Bezdon, Vasiliy and a couple of adults, presumably their assigned caretakers. She stood up and approached them.

"Welcome to Murmansk, boys. Hope the ride was nice." - Vici waved at them with her left hand, as the other hand was occupied by her phone.

"Vivi! It's been a while." - Bezdon fist bumped Victoria.

"Hello again!" - Vasiliy waved to her.

"I know you're happy to meet eachother, but you guys can talk in the vans. Our drivers are waiting." - their step-mother notified the group.

"Alright, alright, yeesh." - they all proceeded forward.

"Hey, Vici, raise your phone and show me what's going on! I wanna see them too." - Adrian's voice was heard from the phone.

"Sorry. Here you go." - she positioned the phone to capture both herself and the new arrivals with the frontal camera. There was a video feed of Adrian on screen, lying in bed.

"I was wondering where the right hand man was. Howdy! Why the video chat?" - Bezdon asked.

"We had a rough day, so he needs some rest. You didn't think we wouldn't meet you together, did you?"

"Wasn't there two more of you guys in the first batch? Jason and that other gal?" - Vasiliy asked.

"Kate refused to go with us, and Jason is in the fucking hospital. You'll never guess who and what got him."

"Already? I guess I should be more surprised only one of you got hospitalized. Unless there was more?" - Bezdon asked with a proud smile.

"No, but it was a wild week. We'll give you a TLDR later."

The new arrivals and Vici hopped into a van, a single one shared with the caretakers and soldiers this time.

"So how's Murmansk been so far? Sounds like you're enjoying it at 200% capacity." - Vasiliy asked.

"Fucking. Awesome." - Adrian answered.

"It's paradise. A grim, ugly, shameful paradise, and it's only a paradise for the likes of us and nobody else. The school is stupid and dysfunctional in the most perfect way, and the police are understaffed. You know what that means? I know you probably miss being the head of GOEW already, but cops in this city aren't above asking us for help. You'll get your supply of power back soon, man. They'll find you something to return you control over the little people. It'll be great." - Vici promised tenderly.

Bezdon's and Vasiliy's new caretakers frowned and stared at her initially, but then went back to normal. "The last part sounds about right. They should." - one of them said.

"Looking at the streets, you're right about the ugly paradise part. I wonder when we'll get to some corpse disposal for the mayor. Or be forced to choose a side between the government and the government." - Bezdon admitted with excitement, and it was obvious whenever it was sarcastic or genuine to every kid in the car.

"Why do you think I like power for the sake of it? Don't you remember how I helped both you and Adrian just because I wanted to? I didn't have to, but I felt like it, and so I did, despite your reputation." - Vasiliy sounded confused and slightly offended.

"I remember, of course, and I appreciate that. Still, you did accept being elected as the leader of GOEW. Nobody gets into a position of power like that without having some degree of greed or lust for power. I am not judging you, I am just saying..." - Victoria started whispering to make herself sound gentler. "Embrace your inner darkness. It's nothing to be ashamed of."

"Oooh! You're right. From now on, I embrace the void. Because might makes right." - he said proudly.

"You know, Vivi, you sound a lot less perpetually depressed these days. You genuinely seem so much happier, more open, less cold… And you've never gotten philosophical with us, let alone tried to become our lifestyle coach." - Bezdon observed.

"Are you saying she's serious?"

"Why wouldn't she be?"

"Bro." - Vasiliy made an awkward face. The "B" was very loud.

"I am curious. If you view him as someone with a closeted dark side, what does that make me?"

"I've always respected you for just going around the lab and destroying everyone. Sometimes for money, sometimes for fun. No allegiances, little principles, just being an honest fighter. I never considered you a friend, but… I don't know. You're just cool, and there's not a single thing about you which I dislike." - Victoria admitted with a much more thoughtful and emotionless tone than earlier.

"You're capable of compliments? That's \*insane\*." - Bezdon was genuinely pleasantly shocked.

She turned away and smiled. "Heh. I'm losing my edge, ain't I?"

"Cap. Remember the torture chamber? Didn't seem like you've lost your edge there." - Adrian reassured.

"The \*what\*?" - Vasiliy was surprised.

"We'll tell you the full story later."

"I haven't been there for whatever happened in the torture chamber, but maybe you've just gained a new internal face rather than changing to be less threatening. To your peers, anyway." - Bezdon suggested.

"Not even just peers anymore. She's capable of a lot more than just that deathly coldness we're all too familiar with, and her skills will only get honed with time as she tries over and perfects different approaches." - Adrian turned sideways along with his phone.

"Alright, alright." - Vici couldn't decide between sarcastically rebuking them both for reassuring her or genuinely just saying "thanks", but after a few moments, she chose the third option. "You know, Bez, how come you don't have your void tentacles anymore?"

"They didn't allow me to have them always spread out like you've always seen me do. Because it 'makes me stand out a lot' or something, total bullshit."

"We've told you, someone might kill you and try to harvest you. I am sorry, but it's critical for your own safety and there's simply no other way. You need to make sure that the only people who see it are police officers and military members, or if you know for sure they will die or get caught shortly after they see it, which is all, of course, null and void if your life is in danger or it's important for the mission." - his assigned step-dad explained.

"We've been told something similar about Vici and her ice. Considering the crown is fine, only manipulation of ice seems like something she can't do, but using pre-made ice equipment is fine. Personally, I also think it's complete horseshit. Born with these amazing powers and I can't even prank unsuspecting people with it. It's my favorite thing ever." - Adrian admitted with frustration.

"Adrian, Bezdon, please, use your head and think. There's a high chance the abilities you possess are exclusive to you and you alone in the whole wide world of around 9 billion. People are jealous, and sometimes not even the social structure of the Motherland is enough to deter people from trying to harvest what makes you tick like a common bionic eye or leg. We can't assign a robot to monitor all of you all day as that would almost certainly make you feel chained and might compromise some of the tasks you might be given…"

"Yea, no shit." - Victoria confirmed, frustrated.

"But guys, please. You are the future of Omnislavia and all that is righteous, all of you. It's amazing what modern medicine can do, we can even conditionally cure death, but if one of \*you\* dies, the body would detonate from inside as a failsafe against being captured by enemy countries, and at that point there wouldn't be enough of you left to resurrect."

A tense silence filled the dirty, just barely tolerable air of the van.

"The fuck do you \*mean\* we're rigged to explode on death? You're literally leaving an opening for enemies to hack our detonation devices from the outside and kill us without a fight. How is that a good system?" - Victoria's frustration spiked.

"There's nothing to hack in a traditional way, it's completely offline. There are even several failsafes to prevent something like EM storms from detonating you. The only way you're combusting is if the device gets a relatively long confirmation on several levels that you're completely and thoroughly dead. It even registers what kind of death you've suffered, preventing detonation if you drown, for example." - the boys' new step-mom explained.

"Hmph." - Vici gave her a judgmental side eye, still not content with the prospect of being rigged with an explosive.

Another couple hours later, Vasiliy, Bezdon, Adrian, Victoria and Kate were on the same bed where Adrian and Jason were talking earlier, left to right with Kate furthest on the right. She was looking at something in the fancy phone in her hands. There was an empty chair opposite of them.

"May aswell take a look at the recording. The screen is really small, though. Gonna be hard to see anything." - she observed sadly.

"What about the huge TV on your left?" - Vasiliy asked.

"Can we even connect to that?"

"Worth a shot. Adrian, can you grab the remote under it and press the big red button?" - Victoria said before stretching out on the bed to the left side. Everyone else soon followed, other than Adrian who was busy with the remote.

"Where do I lie down?" - Vasiliy asked.

"You're gonna have to grab that chair we put Kate's phone on. Probably better than trying to squeeze yourself between us somewhere. Adrian, is it not working?" - Vici asked, noticing that Adrian had been fruitlessly pressing a button over and over.

"Damn it, okay." - Vasiliy grabbed the chair and positioned it to the side of the bed so he could fit. He didn't sound that bothered.

"Nope. Pressing the red button, no results. Oh, there's a different one here. What if-" - he pressed it, and the TV was lit up with a news program. "Damn. Now, where can I lie down?" - he handed Kate the remote.

"You can take your place on my lap. I can make you a headrest with my arms after me and Kate are done figuring out how to connect her phone to the big screen." - Victoria offered.

"Assuming I won't crush you, that sounds good." Everyone else looked like they had something to say about the offer, but only Kate said anything, and it was just "Aww".

As they were busy figuring out the controls, the TV was projecting today's news about how a bank and a store were robbed by dissident children in Murmansk, who have been successfully captured and admitted to a military school for rehabilitation. In other news, the average income has increased by 1.3% over the last month alone and 157 missiles fired by Pakistan have all been intercepted, and a whole other load of nonsense which the children had absolutely no way to tell what was and wasn't real. Eventually, they finished setting it up and played the recording on the big screen.

The TV showed Adrian, Vici and Kate sitting in a line on the right side of the same bed. The left side of the camera view was weirdly empty, like they forgot to put themselves in the center of the view.

"Hello there." - Adrian opened.

"Hey. We've been offered to send you guys a video message of us in Murmansk by the adults, so here we are. The TLDR is, this city has everything we've ever wanted, pretty much all the things we didn't have available before. But the city is also struggling with a ton of problems and it's generally just in a sad state." - Kate narrated.

"Which means there's a load of things to do, problems to solve, problems to create, money to be made, discord to spread. Friends to be made too, probably, but having eachother was enough." - Victoria continued, counting upsides of moving out with fingers.

"...Yea, it really depends on how you look at it."

"But seriously, come here and join us. I won't even shower you with a hailstorm of ice shards. Probably." - Kate covered her mouth, silencing a laugh.

"God damn it, Vici." - present Kate remarked, borderline laughing.

"I mean, honesty is important sometimes." - present Victoria shrugged.

"I don't think I need to say which outlook I am choosing on all this." - past Adrian said with a sparkling smile. "Either way, we're not the only ones here at this point. Meet the new arrivals." - he signaled Bezdon and Vasiliy with his right arm to come out from behind the camera and fill the weird empty space on the bed to the left, which was intended for them all along. "How do you feel about the prospect of living in this city with us, Mr. Eldritch Monster?" - Adrian asked like a reporter before pulling out a pencil from his pocket and putting it in front of Bezdon's mouth like a microphone.

"Heard the locals aren't very receptive to beaten the fuck out of, but I'll probably find a way to apply myself somewhere." - he answered.

"Okay, thank you, Mr. Eldritch Monster. What about you, Mr. Fellow Psychic?" - Adrian gave Vasiliy the pencil.

"I am still too early to judge anything, but it sounds like I will both get my giant dog and have something to do in my freetime." - Vasiliy shrugged. "Best idea we've ever had collectively. Thank you for the opportunity, Victoria, I really regret not supporting you from the start."

"Don't even trip about it. Your support as a human shield has been most helpful." - she replied, causing everyone to wheeze and laugh, with even Vasiliy shaking his head and smiling. The children of the present also couldn't help but to laugh along.

"You did that? Why am I not surprised?" - past Kate asked with a smile of disappointment.

"I wonder why, me." - present Kate agreed with an intensely sarcastic tone.

"Should have said that was a violation so I would spend a few minutes arguing otherwise and losing my concentration." - past Vici shrugged.

"Alright, alright, does anyone have anything else to say before we stop the recording? I've got a few words for the old gang." - Adrian asked, recovering from the nuclear warhead Vici dropped.

"I've got some for \*my\* old gang too." - Kate said.

"I've also got something I'd like to leave for last. Mind if Adrian goes first? Actually, no, nevermind. You guys pick." - Victoria offered as she started rapidly typing something on her phone.

"That's okay, I can wait. Hit 'em with it, Kate." - Adrian wanted to pass the pencil to Kate before realizing he didn't take it from Vasiliy. It would have been too awkward to get it back for such a performative gesture.

Kate started going on about how great it would be to see her friends again and how she misses them. At the same time, Vici showed Adrian whatever she wrote on her phone, after which he crawled backwards deeper onto the bed, then to his left, and gave Kate a middle finger devil horn on her left side. Victoria moved closer and did the same with the other side when she noticed.

Kate turned her head around. "What are you doing? You're ruining my speech." - all 3 of them laughed intensely while Bezdon watched with amusement and Vasiliy couldn't help but smile.

The present kids were also amused by the interaction, even if their reactions were a lot more muted. "Your sociopathic personality will never properly hide the fact that you're a giant doofus." - present Kate commented.

"Well now you're just flirting with me." - present Victoria responded, smiling. Present Kate shook her head awkwardly and didn't respond, and present Adrian snore-laughed.

After past Kate was done, past Vici said:

"Oh, almost forgot. To the same people as Kate's message was addressed…" - she flipped a bird at the camera and grinned. "I hope you die a painful death, you insufferable wastes."

Vasiliy looked at her with concern, Bezdon laughed quietly, Adrian put his lips between his teeth, and Kate wanted to say something before interrupting herself, turning her head away from everyone and covering her mouth for a decent while. Present Kate also turned her head away and started repeatedly blinking for a while, present Victoria closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath, and present Adrian, Bezdon and Vasiliy changed their facial expressions to sadness, awkwardness and awkwardness again.

"Well, my turn." - Past Adrian announced abruptly before proceeding to address his old friends, saying how even though they weren't talking together for a while, it's been great spending time together and even though he doesn't have time to spend much time together due to other priorities, he has some time and opportunities for games so it's not all bad.

Lastly, it was Vici's turn to speak:

"Moni, get your ass over here. I know it'll take a few months worst case scenario for your whole block to get here, but still. Just doesn't feel right otherwise, you know."

"It's her weird way of saying we miss you. Which we do." - Adrian transcribed.

She sighed. "Okay, that about does it. Kate, you can end the recording." - Kate took the phone from the chair into her own hands, everyone waved and said extra goodbyes, and playback ended.

"That was great, wasn't it?" - present Adrian asked.

"No. Will need to cut some stuff out. Maybe the adults can handle it for us." - Vici replied.

"Didn't you say you wanted to keep as much of it together to keep the natural chaos of the recording intact, even if it hurts the pacing?" - Bezdon asked.

"Yes, and I haven't changed my mind. But I feel like we really shouldn't send it in with me saying \*that\* to Kate's friends. It's not like I didn't mean it, I did, and I do wish the worst on them. At the same time, they'll probably perceive this as a threat, which they're guaranteed to take seriously, which could backfire in a plethora of ways. No, we have to cut it out, as good as it did feel to say it."

"Thank you. I really wanted to ask that but I didn't think I had any right to say anything." - Kate said sadly, her head still turned away.

"Right? Are you still on about that? Come on, snap out of it." - Victoria grabbed Kate's shoulder and gave it a noticeable shake.

"You're not a henchwoman to me, you have the right to be honest to me. Don't strip yourself of your agency, that just makes me feel like an abusive camazon."

Next morning, Adrian and Vici were taking a walk outside.

"We're getting close. It's about time I've revealed the surprise." - she started in a mildly excited voice before pulling out 2 packs of white sticky notes from a pocket along with 2 pens, giving one of the sets to Adrian.

"Sticky notes? Thought you wanted to go here to rest from work. Are you planning on folding them into what looks like drones so we could clear the cash register?" - Adrian clicked the pen a few times because he could. And the sound was nice.

"Heh. I am not that deranged. It's not for something else. You see, these may look like ancient low-volume flash drives, and to a casual observer, that's all they are. However, these are also weapons of mass destruction. Let me give you a demonstration." - she stopped, wrote something on a note and showed Adrian. "Avoid the bald man or you will die. Hmm…"

"That's not all." - Vici turned around, put the pen and sticky notes in one hand, took out the top one with a free hand and attached the note to a car window before brushing her free hand with the back of her occupied one. It really didn't look as cool as she wanted it to. "There. Now the owner of this car will fear bald people for the rest of their life. And that is how you spread \*terror\*." - she made an evil laugh.

"That's foul. And awesome. Are we gonna get in trouble over this?"

"How? That's the thing, we're just giving people cryptic messages in the eyes of the law. Not violent, not coherent, just random bullshit. Try it."

"Okay, okay. Here goes." - Adrian made another note and showed it off with a smile.

"No, no, you're missing the point. You gotta be less direct. It's scary, for sure, but they'll probably just be a little shocked for one day and get over it when they realize everything is fine. You gotta have more finesse, more details, while being vague enough to for sure get some right. Or you could lean into heart attack in the moment through lying about something bad happening."

"Ooooh, got it. Here's a better one." - Adrian made a notion for sticking the note into a random grate.

"You can still stick it onto a car. It's not like we don't have enough of them to go around. I'll write an example of leaning into terror in the moment angle."

"What's it gonna be this time?" - he asked with curiosity, attaching his sticky note to a different other car. It said, "I will steal your kidney and cook it for dinner".

Victoria finished her new note and stuck it to a rear window of another car after showing the contents to Adrian. It read, "Sorry for scratching your car :(". "It's not overtly threatening, but it's gonna give the owner a hell of a heart attack followed by intense disappointment in allowing themselves to be fooled like that. How do you like it?"

"You're just too awesome. You're powerful enough to ruin someone's day in 20 seconds. That's gotta be a record, right?" - Adrian asked joyfully.

"I could pop any of these tires with an ice needle in 3. Not that I care to. Anyway, show me what you had in mind." - Adrian wrote and showed off, "Bring us a litre of blood or there will be consequences - The Vamps". "Yessss. You're using an example of real people who could actually pose danger for all anyone knows, with realistic motives. You've done well, my apprentice. Let's see if I can one up that."

And so they kept going, and going, and going, making and sticking notes ranging from heinous to absolutely vile. They eventually reached the target theme park of Fruitnaz and its parking lot and continued having fun with notes until they got bored 19 sticky notes later and finally went to buy tickets inside. The line only had a couple of people before it was their turn.

"Are your parents around?" - an elderly lady asked at the counter. Adrian was pretty sure he saw starving African children from media less underweight than her.

"No, they're not. We don't have parents." - Victoria answered.

"Uh huh. Sorry, children, you need parental supervision to be in here." - it was obvious she didn't buy it.

"We're with the military. We're grown enough to not cause any damage." - Victoria showed her own and Adrian's dark green ID cards with a beautiful logo of a golden lightbulb orbited by 3 electrons on the back side and "OMP MLB" underneath. Omnislavian Ministry of Peace, Mind of Liberty Branch.

After successfully buying the tickets for a total of 5.6K bears and surrendering Adrian's dull ice sword, they've been successfully allowed inside.

"We're in. Where do you wanna go?" - Vici asked.

"Where do \*you\* wanna go? I never watched this shitty cartoon from the 60's. I always found it stupid how the vegetables were always the bad guys who did bad things because they were bad."

"That's just in the episodes past 2079, the rest of it is great. These must be references to even newer episodes here, though. Happle's Gravity Exercises, Melly's and Lemmy's Mineshafts, Harrlick's Deadly Attack? Dude, he was annihilated across all universes by the Brawlnana Council because his voice actor was jailed for funding dissidents, and now they've brought him back for some reason? Okay, bro. No wonder there's so little people here." - her speed of speech was gradually accelerating.

"I guess I choose the mineshafts. You know, maybe I do need to give the older seasons a go with you. What if you're right? Also, how did you always dream of going to a place like this and then have no conception of what to do?"

Victoria shrugged. "No idea. It just always felt too distant to really think about."

As they were waiting in a green and yellow hall filled with frames of Melly and Lemmy doing all kinds of stuff together, from fighting a zombie tomato apocalypse with M16's to sniffing flowers, a family of 3 ahead in the line had a toddler who wouldn't stop loudly crying.

"God, if I have to endure this crying for one more minute… Not even shutting my ears works, he's just so loud." - Adrian suffered with his face covered.

"Are you okay, hun? Do I need to sort this out?" - Vici offered tenderly, trying to comfort him with shoulder pets.

"No… I can wait some more. It's all good."

"I hear you loud and clear." - she stood up and stood in front of the family up ahead. "Hey you, shut your fucking camazonling before I do something. You're not all alone here, you're hurting someone I care about." - Vici requested with mild anger.

"How dare you call my perfect, beautiful, sweet bunbun that? You kiss your mother with that tongue?" - the toddler's mom yelled back. The her preteen daughter just laid back and closed her eyes.

"Bitch, he is polluting the air with his stench and his devilish screams. Don't try to make everyone else suffer for your complete lack of competence as a mother, it's all your fault." - her volume grew.

"Aren't you a little short to be telling me how to be a mother, little girl? Sit the hell down."

"I am more adult than you, shitface. You're only admitting defeat by using the age card. Shut your little devil up already."

But her intervention didn't help. The toddler never ceased crying, and the yells and cries of everyone formed an insufferable, devilish cacaphony of raw nightmares, which made Adrian feel even worse.

The duo eventually walked out of the building, heading for Happle's Gravity Exercises. Adrian looked the most dead inside he ever has, and Vici's face has turned red from the whole exchange.

"How fucking entitled do some people have to be? She could always gag the little imp, or tape his mouth shut, or give him one of those infant mouth lids, but she didn't. She just wanted to make everyone around her suffer and earbleed. I am definitely gonna pop a tire with my ice spikes on the way out, maybe even a few. Might even smash a few windows for dessert, or maybe even kick a hobo if none of that helps. Jesus, I hate humanity. Maybe being destined to kill people until I die was the best thing that ever happened to me." - she ranted, speaking much faster than usual. "Overwhelmed? I can understand. Maybe one day we can earn a licence to kill so we can dissuade assholes from ruining our day with a single silent stare."

Waiting in the Happle building was no problem, even if it took a while and even if Adrian never said a single word. It was themed about the same as the previous one, except it was red, yellow and green, and there was Happle instead of Lemmy or Melly. Eventually, they were allowed into a small cabin which was very slowly moved up around 15m into the sky before slowly descending back down, part of a conga line of other cabins. It was mostly transparent.

"Do you feel any better? I am starting to get worried." - Victoria asked Adrian when they were around 11m in the air.

He sighed, staring at the floor. "Yea. Just, thinking about whatever we're riding right now."

"Still trying to recover?"

"I've recovered, no worries." - he took a look at the many bite marks on his left arm. "Just trying to understand why are these things so slow. They've remade the ferris wheel, yet still kept it insanely slow. They wouldn't be made if nobody liked them, but I just don't get what I'm missing. I don't feel bored right now, I am always happy to be near you, but I know other people don't have the same privilege."

"You're not wrong to wonder about that." - she paused for a few seconds. "Personally, though, I have everything I've ever wanted in life. Friends, money, something to do. And you." - Vici took a quick breath with closed eyes and slowly kissed Adrian's cheek.

He turned his head towards her and smiled, feeling euphoric. "I was wondering when you were gonna do that."

"I was wondering when \*you\* were gonna do that."

"Oh no, are we gonna make a habit of talking like this?" - he produced a small exhale.

"Don't you dare switch topic in this moment. Do it." - Victoria requested playfully. "Unless you're having second thoughts, of course."

"Okay, okay." - he complied, also choosing a cheek even though the forehead would have made an easier target. "Wasn't trying to weasel out of this. Thought you'd appreciate the irony."

"I did, actually." - she embraced him. "I guess now we know the real purpose of these slow ass things."

"Yes…"

They sat back in their normal positions, arms behind eachothers' backs this time. "You know, I really hoped you'd go first and I'd be forced to see if I still hate it. The kissing business back in the lab may have helped us financially, but it was also so uncomfortable. And it's not like I could do much more, I've made my prices sky high and it's like it didn't matter at all. Should have made them even higher by 10 tokens."

"You never told me." - Adrian replied sadly.

"Because my feelings didn't matter, and there's no use dwelling on feelings detrimental to the task at hand. An unfortunate residue remained, but I did what I had to do. If you're ready for a storytime, I can elaborate further."

He performatively shook his head in surprise with wide eyes. "Is that even a question? Of course I am ready."

"I don't know. I am new to this 'being considerate' thing." - Vici's tone shifted to sad for the first time in a while. "You know, the 20K deal responsible for us being here now? It was offered to me not long after the disaster. It was plainly just mockery, a way to stomp me into the ground even further, standard adult behavior. The moment I awakened as a Starblood, you know what's the first thing I tried to do. Or, at least, you can guess."

"I think so. Thank fuck for the adults."

"Agreed. After that didn't work, I realized that, hey, I am a fucking Starblood, maybe there's another way out, and so I camped the roads and attacked random people to learn how to fight. It felt rude, but failure was always more painful, and so I knew what I had to do: suck it up, concentrate and do it. Not long after, my success rates started approaching 100%, and I switched to doing this for tokens in hopes that one day I'll earn enough to buy my freedom. 2 months later I was completely numb to any discomfort that came with it."

"Even if you were only 2 or 3 times stronger than average, you would have reached 16 years before you could reach that. So, what happened?"

"Oh, it was even worse in reality. I'd say I was about 1.5 times stronger than average by that point, but I knew my powers and technique would grow and that'd improve, and they did."

"Can attest to that."

"However, that didn't help enough. Around 1.5 years later, I noticed my income was stagnant, and I found out why. You can't achieve success in this world with pure brawn, and so I started relearning how to talk with people. Sofia served me as a wonderful target dummy, I think she enjoyed how fucked in the head I was."

"And then you've learnt how to apply your social skills to earn money?"

"Of course, that was the point. It felt even weirder at first, especially how I couldn't tell Sofia I looked at her as a business partner rather than a friend, but by now you know how I overcame that." - Vici's tone became less sad.

"Swallow it up and do it."

"Or not do it, like in her case. And don't spoil the future arc where I'll have to seduce and fuck people for the sake of whatever mission I'll be given, we're still 7 years early for swallowing." - she produced a strained laugh and looked downwards.

Adrian was a little disturbed by this, and so he looked down too, then back at her. The reason why Vici brought this up so suddenly completely flew over his head. "But it's no problem for \*the technique\*, right?"

Victoria went back to a neutral tone and looked forward again. "Exactly. And now you know where my power of distancing comes from. Fear, happiness, sadness, boredom, shock and especially anger: all can be exploited to suck their wearers dry. I needed to be strong enough to do that without remorse, and I have adjusted myself accordingly."

"Is that how Revenge of the Girls happened? It was all your elaborate scheme, wasn't it?"

Victoria smiled. "I wish. I've developed the reputation of being the lab's most relentless merc by then, but I wasn't actually included much anywhere, unless someone needed a good icing. The reason why I was invited on board with the plan in the first place was my complete lack of morals and them doing this for anything and everything other than tokens, which means I could have every single one I could extort in the process."

"Heh, clever. I don't feel so bad about getting mugged by you anymore. So what happened after the plan was successfully executed?"

"They've all got pretty much what they wanted. Some boys thought themselves above such coercion, considering they had adults on their side, so that took some laundry work. Laundry work I've been plentifully paid for. But we're getting off topic. What was the main topic, again? Yea. The point is, the kisses weren't anything different, just business as usual. Not like I had any dignity left to sacrifice."

"So you just swallow up all your pain and move on? That's so impressive. You have a will of steel." - Adrian was in mild awe.

"Exactly, and I hope to teach you to be like this too." - it took all her willpower not to make the same joke twice.

After an hour of trying out random stuff, as they were scouring the place for the next thing to check out, Adrian asked:

"Are you sure you're having fun?"

"I am trying to. I really am, just taking a day off so we could enjoy ourselves, but I can't hold it in much longer. The feeling deep inside my head keeps telling me that we could be at the police station making money and learning skills, not being at these mediocre rides wasting our lives." - Victoria admitted in a strained voice.

Adrian shrugged. "Big deal. I am only enjoying this because we're spending time together, not because any of those are particularly fun. I am okay to leave."

"Yes, we probably should. It's like making money is all I've ever known, and now that I can afford headspace for other activities, I still can't help but to resist the old habits."

"It's nothing like that, Vici. You're probably just getting so bored by all this that you'd rather go back to your comfort zone than stay here." - he tried to reassure her.

Victoria stared into nothing, thinking. "Comfort zone. Comfort… zone. You're not wrong, I am so used to the eternal grind that it became my comfort zone rather than work. No, I shouldn't be upset about this. It just means growth and work is natural to me and I will never have to be upset about having to do anything in terms of work. This is \*good\*." - her mood was audibly restored.

"Not what I had in mind, but that works."

Later in the day, they were having a conversation with Adrian's mom in a police station in a hallway. She also assumed the mantle of a cop.

"What. The fuck. I get that you're trying to have fun in less destructive ways, and this is absolutely an improvement, but don't you realize that people might take these notes seriously and it might disrupt their work?" - she oozed frustration. Adrian has never seen her in a mood like this.

"It's just notes filled with nonsense. How bad can they be, and even then, what kind of crime would this constitute as?" - Vici asked in the same innocent tone as earlier and shrugged.

"Criminal mischief. And don't give me those innocent eyes, Victoria. We know that you know that even small combinations of words can have immense power, even in text. No more, got it? Only legal, non-harmful ways to have fun from now on."

"Literally 1984."

S2E7 - And They Run When The Sun Comes Up

Around a week has passed since the arrival of Bezdon and Vasiliy into Murmansk. All 6 children from the lab have begun proper integration into the police, and were even provided with special badges to wear on outside jobs. In the end, thanks to their deep and efficient cooperation, everyone involved was happy to find themselves in positions they were in.

On 31st of December 2090, Adrian and Victoria entered a jail cell and found a late-middle aged man inside, tied up to a chair. He was dressed in ragged shorts, seemed to have normal weight and was not gagged.

"It's a dude. So, does he have the knowledge or the key to get to the surprise, or is he the surprise itself?" - Adrian tried to guess.

"All 3 to one degree or another. This man got a life sentence for delivering food to a dissident organization, and there was also something about domestic violence, I don't know." - she was typing something on her phone between speech.

"I've never hit my wife in my lifetime. They've interpreted a slap-like movement on-" - the man tried to explain, frustrated.

"Shut up, adults are talking." - Vici quickly pulled out an ice maraca with a free left hand and threw it at him, shattering it mid-air and covering the convict with ice shards. Or not even a convict, she wasn't actually sure, not that it mattered. "As you know, Adrian, people who get full life sentences are always either conscripted or made to do forced labor. But sometimes they're not physically or mentally able to pay back their debts that way, and the police has to dispose of them, as there's a variety of uses for both living and dead people like that."

"Living? Do we have our own Unit 731 or something?" - Adrian was surprised, but not even remotely shocked.

"I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised. Either way, I've coordinated the cops to let you do the honors of executing this guy. It took some convincing, they agreed with my methods in the end."

"Wait, already? Oh, I didn't think this would happen so soon." - he turned away and started thinking.

"Yea, sometimes life just comes at you fast, and you need to be strong enough to push through." - Victoria put away her phone,, took Adrian's sword, quickly sharpened the edges with her powers, handed it back to him, gave his shoulder a gentle pet, and took her phone again. "Dewit. It's your chance to finally ascend."

"You don't need to do this. I know I am already dead, but your mind isn't ready to handle a killing. Don't traumatize yourself just because your superiors push you to." - the tied-up man suggested, no fear in his voice.

Victoria made a quick step towards him mid speech, but stopped and thought for a moment until he was finished talking. "I was thinking to gag him to make him less distracting, but it's even better if he cries and begs you for mercy. Humanity, sentience and personal uniqueness don't absolve anyone from pain or death. So keep talking, adult."

"I have nothing to say to you, damn yandere maniac. Just because you've been ruined, it doesn't mean you must ruin your friends too."

Vici shrugged. "Tough words for a living plot device of Adrian's ascension. We're all trying to do our jobs here, and now it's time for you to do yours." - she approached Adrian and gave him another shoulder tap, putting her phone in the left hand. None of them knew whoever Yandrei was. The man looked very confused, probably at being called a "living plot device". "Dewit, Adrian. Choose your method and execute the target."

As Vici stepped away to observe with one eye and type with another, Adrian faced his target, and looked at his sword for a few moments. "Suck it up, concentrate and do it." - he whispered, and thought in his head a few times after. Eventually, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and prepared to decapitate the prisoner in one swing of his sword. Vici smiled at him and gave him a thumbs up, but he was too focused on the task at hand. He moved closer and went for the swing, but it wasn't nearly strong enough to cut off the head, only making a bleeding cut in the neck, which caused him to panic a little. As the target was bleeding, coughing and groaning, Adrian held his hair and tried to cut through the rest of him that way, but the neck bone was too strong to cut through. Thankfully, by the time Adrian reached it, the man stopped making sounds.

"You did it! Welcome to manhood. I knew you could do it. Good save, too. How are you feeling?" - Victoria asked supportively.

"That wasn't so bad." - Adrian replied emotionlessly, walking around the cell aimlessly while looking downward with his bloodied hands behind his back and his sword back in the sheathe.

"Good, good. You have done well, my apprentice." - she channeled her inner Palpatine all the while still quickly typing something. "Now, it's best that you go home or generally spend some time alone in whatever way you're comfortable with and think it all over, start to finish. Analyze and process your feelings, introduce yourself to them if they're new, and if any of them make you feel bad, remember: you did what you had to do and there's no shame in it. This man sacrificed his life so you could live yours to the fullest."

"Mmm hmm."

"And if you need to talk about this, send me a message and I'll respond. I'll probably be busy with training or torture or pedophiles for a while, but I'll try my best to help." - Vici approached and embraced him. "I am proud of you."

After washing his hands and going home as suggested, around half an hour later he began arguing with himself over what he's done before finally internally accepting it as something completely fine and natural around 2 hours after. He was mostly using his opportunity to chat with Victoria to flirt with her, even if her one-ups were a hell of a lot more powerful than anything he could muster. He also chatted with Matt for a while about whenever replayability or the first time experience is more important in games or not, and by the end both were ranting about the first being neglected completely.

Not long before midnight, Kate and Adrian were leading Vici somewhere as she was \*still\* doing something on her phone while paying just enough attention to the road not to bump into anything. It was snowing outside, so she attached a very wide brim to her crown helmet temporarily, turning it into a crown helmet sombrero to prevent the snowflakes from landing on her screen. The brim was curved to make the rainwater pour backwards instead of forwards or sideways.

"While I don't have an exact idea where you're leading me, I sure hope it's not gonna cost us some crazy money." - Victoria said.

"Don't worry about money. I've covered everything from my own coffers." - Kate assured her.

"I know you're hardwired against getting your mind off of money, but at least give it a try. We're trying to do our best to bring you joy for once for this special day. Or night, I guess." - Adrian added.

"I second that. And you don't need to do your reverse-grooming with state-provided alt accounts all day, every day. It's not like they'll go anywhere if you take a break for the rest of the day."

Victoria paused her lightning-fast typing. "But I don't wanna take a break. I am being rewarded for my amazing performance, and I just love making sure they never see freedom again and likely die. Half a year of this and I'll rid Omnislavia of molesters entirely. Is that not an amazing goal to strive for?"

"It is, and you're doing it exceptionally well, but you're leaving no room to breathe for your soul." - Vici tumbled but regained balance. "And you're not doing that good of a job looking at the road, this is the second time. Come on. At least wait until we get there so you don't get run over by a car. Not all of them are auto-piloted." - Kate begged in an appropriate tone.

Vici finished typing something and put away her phone. "Fine. I'll get better at multitasking typing with walking. Hopefully this one won't get too impatient if I don't feed him a little while." - she reluctantly agreed, frustrated.

"Feed him? Don't tell me you mean THAT kinda feed." - Kate asked with mild disgust.

"It's nudes, Kate, yes." - Adrian replied neutrally.

"Oh god… I'm gonna puke… Why would you ever agree to this…" - she covered her mouth and turned her face away.

"They're AI generated, Kate, don't worry about it. I've got an arsenal of CP in my storage so large it'd be enough to put me away for several lifetimes if I wasn't underage myself, and it's not like I use it on \*everyone\* because that's not always optimal. You won't believe how advanced and undetectable imagegen is now, there's a reason access to that technology is restricted even to cops themselves. But at the end of the day, it's just a tool to get the job done, just like my phone, or like LemonLime." - Vici assured her, still irritated.

"Imagine waking up in 2030's and watching an AI-generated streamer play a game full of AI-generated textures with AI-generated chat on a platform monitored by AI while masturbating to AI-generated porn." - Adrian shook his head.

"He meant \*corn\*. Eating AI-generated corn. He thinks 'masturbating' means 'eating'." - Victoria tried to salvage before making a gesture of a horizontal closed hand moving up and down twice near Adrian, which was a previously established gesture of "Wrong time to say this". He began overanalyzing what he said to see what he could have possibly said at a wrong time. "Imagine if civilians could access that shit today, even if it wasn't free like back in the day. It'd be like the thirties, but even worse, reality and fiction would become one and we would all drown in a deep sea of all-encompassing uncertainty." - she sighed deeply. "Thank fuck that's not the case. I pity any country that didn't handle it the same way we did. Wait, what were we even talking about?"

Kate didn't buy the corn line, but she figured it'd be better to pretend otherwise. "Your methods. You know, I really think what you're doing is completely justified and even noble, but at the same time, I worry about you two sometimes." - Kate admitted sadly.

"Nothing to worry about, sis, we're just a little quirky is all."

Eventually they've arrived into a restaurant, \*descriptions i have no fucking clue how to do\*. As they opened the door and went inside, Adrian made a joyful "tada" while Vici detached the brim from her crown, deconstructed it into ice maracas and put them away in her vast pockets.

"We did some homework and found us and you in particular the perfect place to spend the night together! We've also reserved a table with couches and ordered all your favorite food and most of what you wanted to try out." - Kate presented.

"And you two managed to find a place with most of what I wanted in only a few hours when I was working alone today? That's impressive. And sweet. You two are the best." - Victoria expressed her gratitude as she sat down between her companions at the same time with them on a semicircular-like couch. She was pretty sure she'd cry on the spot if she didn't see the outline of the surprise a mile away, but it was still very heartwarming.

"And this isn't even the best part."

"Hey, this spot is reserved and paid for. Pick a different spot." - a sleepy young adult server dressed in orange and brown clothing approached them.

"Yea, by me." - Kate took out her phone and showed him the transaction log after a few moments of searching. "Would you mind bringing us any food which is currently ready? The special lemonade, mainly."

The server nodded and walked away. "Oh, the lemonade! Not the standard LemonLime we drink, the good shit." - Adrian's neurons flared.

"The good shit? Hell yea, you have my attention." - Vici's neurons also flared, even if it was less visible.

Kate giggled. "Sweet teeth. I hope you're enjoying the date I've taken you out to. Yes, I said it. I can make things weird too for no reason. Are you proud of me?"

Adrian laughed lightly. "Very." - Vici put her hand on Kate's shoulder.

"Oh right, we forgot something important." - she suddenly moved closer to Victoria and embraced her. Adrian did the same.

"Oh… This is surreal, even for you two. I feel weird, like reality isn't real. Even I don't feel real." - Vici admitted in a dazed tone.

"We love you too!" - Adrian said tenderly.

"We were meant to do this after the initial reveal, but I guess we just both forgot." - Kate noted.

"I would have died. Maybe I am dying already. Is this what ecstasy meant to feel like? That's not how I thought it would." - Victoria spoke uncharacteristically slowly.

"Maybe you just feel it differently. Hey, this is a perfect moment to take a group photo for the memories. Everyone, sit upright."

Everyone sat upright, except Victoria who was already in a proper position. "Yea, maybe if one of us dies in battle, the rest of us can look at it and remember the good times." - Adrian said.

Vici smiled, still stuck in the clouds. "Adrian, no. Don't make this moment depressing. I know she reinforces you when you do that, but I won't. Just try to be normal and wholesome for a few moments." - Kate requested as she was setting up the camera. It wasn't clear whenever she was genuinely frustrated or still a little entertained by the comment. Victoria was too confused by her mental state to deny that she reinforced that behavior. Eventually, they've managed to create a photo with happy Adrian making a peace sign and Kate leaning against dazed Vici who was staring into nothingness with a slight smile.

Some time later, Adrian and Kate were eating various sorts of food like a gelatinous cake and crab meat while Victoria was munching on raw lemons and limes, salvaged from glass cups of lemonade, fully recovered from the daze by this point. There was also a dish full of unfinished aspic near her and a small stack of empty dishes away from all of them. Adrian had 3 glasses of lemonade, Kate had 1, all of them empty. Vici had 2, one was empty and the other half-empty, with the remaining lemonade slowly dwindling through periodic sips.

"You know, you two were right about the lemonade. It's so much richer in taste, and the temperature makes it so much better. I'd make my own soda if we weren't busy with work." - she admitted.

"I would be hella down if you change your mind. Man, the same 3 christmas tracks are making my ears bleed. Don't they have like a bigger variety, and not just a variety of "Jingle Bells" remixes?" - Adrian asked.

"No idea. I feel the same, but if that's the price I have to pay for being able to chew on Kate's bank account with no problems, then I am fine to take it. I don't know why are you so scared of a little sourness in your lives, this shit's gourmet."

"Like I said, I really don't mind as long as you enjoy it. Seeing you smile is invaluable to me." - Kate affirmed.

"You're too sweet. But yes, I love it. I know, I didn't actually like most of what I said I'd like to try out and you two had to eat it on my behalf, but the rest of it? Priceless. I am leaving the aspic for last, never ate anything better in my life. Speaking of, why are both of you giving me special treatment today?" - Adrian and Kate looked at eachother awkwardly, then slowly descended into a snort-laughter in a feedback loop of seeing eachothers' face expressions. Vici just looked at them both in confusion, still chomping on the lime insides attached to the shell while trying to get what they were laughing about. "I know you don't have any reason to buy my disposition since you've already got all of it. Is this some sort of a winter joke?" - her friends laughed harder. "Very well. Keep your secrets, shitheads." - she smiled and wanted to get back to eating, but then heard a familiar trumpet stinger. All 3 of them turned their heads towards a TV the sound was coming from. "Oh, no. I was hoping I wouldn't have to hear the same worthless speech this year at least. Yea, our country is great, our enemies aren't, you don't like the leader of the other major party, you want everyone to think yours is the only one which would lead the Motherland to greatness even though the main parties have like 5 policy differences at most. Yes, daddy President, fill my ears with nothing I don't already know. Go ahead." - she said in exasperation.

"I am pretty sure the parties aren't nearly the same." - both Kate and Adrian were also bored before it even started, but not nearly as intensely. "They disagree on a lot of stuff. Economy, cosmetic cybernetics, internal immigration are the big ones."

"Whatever."

At some point, the President appeared. He looked like a middle-aged man in cosmetic brown glasses doing his best to look 20 with moderately long black hair and a short, dense beard. The speech congratulated everyone with an upcoming new year, thanked the soldiers on the battlefields for their heroic sacrifice, probably more. He was using the same informal language to pretend to be more human, but the text itself was pulling in the opposite direction. He also started making comparisons of the current wars to WW2 and the Turkish soldiers to nazis, at which point Victoria quickly pulled out her headphones, connected them to her phone and shut herself out of the rest of the speech with a random metal playlist she found online blasted on full volume. The screams were weird and music was generally repetitive and bad, yet she closed her eyes with a feeling of serenity and started taking long, deep breaths of various unfinished food. Eventually, she felt tapping on both sides, which caused her to quickly open her eyes and look left to right in alertness, but there were only her friends happily looking at her, with a hint of worry in Kate's eyes. She shortly realized the speech was over and it was already 2091. Vici paused the music and removed her headphones.

"Happy birthday and happy new year, sis!" - Kate clapped, sticking to the script.

"Welcome to being eleven!" - Adrian also clapped.

"Are you serious? My birthday is the first day of the year?" - Victoria was still readjusting after her return from the sensory sanctuary.

"Yes!"

"Did you seriously not remember? I thought you were doing a bit earlier." - Kate asked.

"I didn't. Adrian was no better earlier too."

"But how? Birthdays are meant to be special events which you celebrate with your friends. And family, for normal people." - she wondered with slight sadness. Adrian and Vici just looked at eachother awkwardly for a moment and quickly burst into laughter. "Oh my god. No. No." - Kate covered her mouth with a hand.

After getting a hold of themselves, Vici grinned and nodded while Adrian said "Yies".

Eventually they all left for home together. There were ear-bursting fireworks and definitely not sober pedestrians walking around. Adrian was pretty sure he heard a car run into a road sign somewhere.

"Man, I have never been more full in my life. The cake at the end wasn't even that big, and yet it still wouldn't fit. Good thing we have the cleanup crew." - Victoria admitted, actually sounding slightly happy and carefree for once.

"Contact us again anytime." - Adrian smiled. He also sounded like he overate a little.

"Pristine party, K. Not as pristine as what we'll throw for you, but it will do."

As they needed to walk by a very hammered man, he turned towards them and stared, speaking something in Ethanolish. The group stopped for a moment, ready to draw their swords, but Vici's instinctive reaction was to instantly throw 3 pairs of shattering maracas at the drunkard in quick succession. He began comically walking backwards, trying to maintain balance, before collapsing between two cars parked on the road. The stranger tried to move his hands around to get up, but it was fruitless, so the group moved on.

Kate took a quick breath of surprise. "This confirms my suspicions. You are still in your prime, they don't have any reasons not to let us or you in particular do any actually dangerous tasks." - she said, agitated.

"What are you saying?" - Victoria was still in a state of cold focus from the encounter.

"I am saying, you don't need to do the same mundane activities you do all day. Let's go fucking hunt some organized criminals, together, all 3 of us. We can do this."

Adrian put his semi-stretched out fingers on his forehead and his heart rate noticeably spiked. "Oh no. Ohhhh no-no-no. I am gonna have to kill another man tonight. It's gonna be so bloody and they'll make sounds as they're dying… Oh man…" - he thought aloud anxiously.

"Are you okay? You said you handled it with no problems. Were you too afraid to tell me the truth? Am I giving you expectations so unreasonable that you need to lie to meet them?..." - Victoria asked sadly, putting a hand on his shoulder and staring into nothing at the same time.

"Vici, did you proceed with your idea?" - Kate asked judgmentally.

"Of course. I know I approached the matter delicately and gave him the best opportunity to absorb and tank it. So where did I fail?"

"Yes, but you \*did\* proceed with your idea. I told you, you'd be ruining his childhood. He might be smart and open-minded, but he is still a child. It's so wrong."

Vici looked at Kate without a face expression and started arguing back, complimenting words with hand motions. "Well, yes, which is why it's critical that he grows up sooner so he can unlock his true potential earlier and live the rest of his early years to the fullest. And I told you that he will eventually have to kill people for a living, probably en masse thanks to being a Starblood, so it might be even better if I introduce him to real death earlier, more gradually and with more emotional support than the military would." - her tone also shifted from sad to neutral and her pacing of speech noticeably accelerated.

"The way I see it, you're just projecting your emotional numbness onto him so he can resemble you better, and it's not about strength but rather perfecting him as a soulmate." - Kate said a lot faster and slightly angrier than earlier.

Victoria rolled her eyes and sighed. "For fuck's sake, Kate. You know that would be out of character."

"But… \*I\* am the one to blame for this in the first place, ain't I? I've planted the virus, and it can't be blamed for wanting to multiply…" - Kate said sadly on normal speed before before turning away.

"No, Kate, we are not having this discussion again. Block these thoughts the fuck out. You know you're stronger than this." - Vici said assertively and looked at Adrian, gradually decelerating her talking speed back to normal. "Look, dear. We don't need to kill anyone if we want to go on a hunt for criminals. We'll probably even be rewarded better if we bring someone alive rather than dead. It's information at best and dirt cheap labor for the government at worst. It'll be fine."

Adrian exhaled in relief. "Phew, thank fuck. And, I didn't lie to you about successfully processing what I did today. I actually thought it was under control, but it resurfaced."

She exhaled in relief. "In that case we'll just have to give you a bit more time. I am really glad we didn't fail just yet. Either way, Kate, you were right earlier. I am choking myself with non-stop work. It's always good to break up work with other work. And I \*am\* getting separated from Adrian uncomfortably frequently these days. How do you feel about doing some vampire hunting?" - Vici asked.

"Amazing. Best possible choice. We also have no idea who they are and what kind of weirdos are they. Should be fun. I'll bring my garlic necklace and wooden stakes." - Kate replied with mild excitement. Or at least Victoria hoped it was.

"What's garlic, again?" - she genuinely did not remember.

"Wait, we're not… Doing this way past midnight, are we?" - Adrian asked worryingly.

"No. Even if I wanted to pull an all-nighter for some reason, we don't even know what vampires look like. I'll think of something which doesn't involve looking for a needle in a haystack. I doubt Kate would agree to just detain anyone who enters any apartment block past midnight either."

After getting home, the girls parted ways with Adrian for the night and went inside their apartment. Their caretakers were just drinking beer in the kitchen and watching something, not worried at all about them arriving home 37 minutes past midnight, as the restaurant visit had been sanctioned prior and everything was under control.

"Wait, before you go. Don't think we've forgotten to give you your gifts for the occasion." - Kate's dad approached the girls with his left hand behind his back. "Victoria, you've been adapting to being a police intern exceptionally well aswell as doing a good job restraining yourself from the more destructive ways to have fun in the last week, and I'd like to wish you a happy birthday. I know your friends have probably showered you with gifts already, but me and my superiors want to make sure your contributions are plentifully rewarded and that you're happy to be working with us, even at such a young age. Here's a flashlight from us." - he pulled out a giant flashlight from his pocket with his right arm.

Victoria took it and turned it on, pointing it at the floor and moving the light around. It looked a decent bit more powerful than what she'd expect from one of those. "Not bad. Thanks."

"It's not just a regular flashlight. High-powered flashlights are standard police equipment and are even freely available for civilian purchase, but this is \*military-grade\* technology designed for special agents. Click that third button from the bottom of the flashlight without pointing at any of us." - Vici complied. "This is the standard luminosity police flashlights employ, but if you ever need to blind someone, press the fourth button from the bottom. Don't press it now, even the reflection of this light might be overwhelming." - Victoria pressed it anyway, but it was indeed way too bright even when reflected against the floor, so she quickly turned it back down. Kate closed her eyes for a moment, but then continued watching with amusement. "Told you. Only use it when you need to, this isn't a toy. Now, try pulling one of these sliders." - and so Vici did, turning the light from bright white to magenta, then to lavender, then to a pukish green.

"RGB sliders? Don't get me wrong, I love this, but what use would Eye of Liberty agents have for this?" - Vici asked.

"Signals. RGB flashlights aren't uncommon and the enemies would need to be seriously paranoid to tell it's a signal. Even changing color mid use would probably be taken as testing capabilities or playing around while you can transmit information. You could even give it to an allied android so it could quickly relay text to another like with morse code. Of course, you'll probably mostly use this to screw around, and we're okay with that. Just make sure we don't get complaints or emergency calls, alright? We don't like \*those\*. Otherwise, enjoy your gift, happy birthday and happy new year."

She turned off the flashlight and put it in one of her pockets. Even an empty one without ice maracas was too big to fully fit in. "No problem. Appreciate it."

"Don't think you're getting left out, Kate." - Kate was so hoping he would say that. "Likewise, we really appreciate your burning passion to learn and bring justice to people living in this city, and it was only right that you'd get something too." - her dad pulled out a black, lavish-looking pistol holster and gave it to her. She gasped in awe. "This is a high-quality holster from advanced synthetic shagreen, or stingray leather. It's functionally and visually identical to the real thing, except it costs 50 times less and doesn't involve poaching. While it's not yet time for you to be allowed to bear a handgun of your own, that time is fast approaching and we hope that you will wear it with pride and responsibility." - Kate just looked at it in a euphoric shock with an open mouth, flipping it around and touching the texture without saying anything.

As the girls walked into the latter's room, Kate took a seat on the bed and continued analyzing the present.

"I can't believe they'd give me something this valuable and fitting. It's so good." - she said quietly.

"Remember that this is bribery, Kate. He said it himself, they're giving us these gifts to give us additional cognitive connections from working for them and good things happening to us." - Victoria put her new flashlight on the table, took a full 3mg tablet of melatonin and drank it up with a sip from a giant LemonLime bottle on her table before taking a seat next to her friend.

"Nah, it doesn't have to be. It's normal for people to receive gifts for New Year's Eve and birthdays."

"Except this is the first time I've gotten anything more substantial than sweets from them, as much as I love them. Even before the big disaster it was \*you\* ladies who were giving me my presents, not the adults."

"It \*is\* weird that the first big physical gifts they ever give us are so lavish. And are work-related." - Kate said as she placed the holster to the side.

"Also true. It makes sense for me, the resident workaholic, but you? No."

"I am still super happy about the gift. They could have gotten me something cheap and barebone, but they didn't, and I'm really happy."

"One of these days you'll become a school shooter. 'Hey guys, check out the tommy gun I snatched from the cops!' before you shoot up the whole place and remind us why there's no second amendment in this country." - Victoria teased, smiling. She did actually feel the same as Kate about her own gift despite the undertones, already theorizing how she could shine it in red or green mode into someone's window to scare them.

Kate laughed. "Where did that come from? We haven't even used tommy guns for something like 140 years. And why is that what you think of me?"

She shrugged in response. "Because everything sucks that much from a normal human perspective and this city is beyond saving. And because you're probably gonna be so excited when you're finally allowed to hold a gun outside of training that you wouldn't be able to help testing it out on live targets."

"Hey, fuck you! I am not that… gun-crazy." - Kate yawned.

"Wouldn't want anyone to be near you when that happens. I could maybe block the bullets if I had enough ice and prep time, but I am not so sure anyone else could say the same."

Kate gave Vici's shoulder a playful poke. "You're so mean!" - Victoria turned at Kate and began staring at her with a face which combined anger, judgement and frustration. "I am so sorry. I didn't mean to." - Kate said anxiously. Victoria kept the stare for around 5 more seconds and burst into intense laughter. "Oh, of course you'd fucking do that, giving me a heart attack so you can laugh at my guillibility. Unless you're just laughing because you're imagining all possible ways you could murder me." - Kate smiled again.

"No… You should have seen the look on your face, dude. It's like life flashed before your eyes and you were praying to Jesus for forg-" - Victoria cleared her throat. "For going to heaven."

"Oh, you think now that you're double 1 too, you can assert your superiority on me through showing me how you're so much mentally stronger than I am? Is that it?" - she switched to a weird tone indicating playful agitation.

"It's not like I wouldn't do that if I was still 10. And you know that I am already, I just like to make your emotions spike."

"Well, if your idea of being mentally strong and mature means being able to do any kind of crime including murder if the price is right, then I shall remain a child, no thank you." - Kate shook her head.

"Your loss. Either way, as I was saying. The big plan is for you to do nothing while me and Adrian infiltrate a virology lab and steal a prototype ultra-potent Corflaids sample and infect Murmansk before we run away. We flee, everyone dies, including the vampires, the end. What do you think?"

Kate laughed for a few seconds, then raised her lower lip and nodded. "Sounds reasonable, but there's one small problem. You promised Adrian we wouldn't kill anyone during the mission." - she answered in a calm tone.

"Oh, right. Guess we'll need something else."

"And why would they keep a Corflaids strain in a lab? History clearly shows viruses are too strong and uncontrollable to be used as weapons, I mean, in the 50's when I don't remember who released Corflaids in the enemy territory, it got so bad that they had to stop the war and help eachother contain it to prevent humanity from literal extinction…"

"Yea, yea, and then the Iron Fist disarmed everyone from nukes and bioweapons so we don't collectively kill ourselves, and told us they'd bring the Boiling if we kept some in secret. I didn't skip history classes, sis. Are you trying to make a point that it's a stupid idea to keep bioweapon research and storage given said history?" - Vici interrupted.

"Yea. Why wouldn't it be a stupid idea?"

"They could be hoping they could frame Turkey or Europe for using bioweapons to invoke Iron Fist's ire on them. Maybe it still is a stupid idea to cheat the world's most powerful and infamous faction, but what if the adults are just that full of themselves?"

"Don't forget to sleep, girls!" - their step-mom requested from outside the room.

"Yes, mom." - Kate replied in a somewhat bored tone.

"Anyway, I am thinking me and Adrian go 'persuade' whoever is the local news guy to drop a fake story about a famous family moving into a very specific apartment block and saying that they haven't set up modern security countermeasures so it looks like a free target. It'd also be a high crime rate area with not enough police to keep order. The vamps will take the bait, you will observe if any of them try to break and enter the listed apartment or apartments the night after and relay the information to us so we can apprehend any of them who tries to leave, plus you can flank them from behind to increase our chances of success before the exit from the apartment block, although we might need to adjust the details of the news post to make the trap less obvious. Anyway, I cuff them, we call the cops, they congratulate us on a job well done and allow us to participate in field missions sooner, win." - Victoria explained, moving her hands around as she did so.

"Clever. Sounds dangerous to the people whose apartments we'd be using as bait, though, and I don't think we could get access to information on which apartments have their residents on vacations or no residents at all. I could try to go around doors and ask them if they'd like to help, and after that you two can talk to the news worker. Maybe that way my role could be limited to combat only and they could alert you instead of myself."

"Sounds good to me, as long as I don't have to annihilate my social battery by doing that." - Vici smiled. "And don't even get me \*started\* on how Adrian would take it. I am trained to overcome extreme discomfort like this and I could handle it if there's no other option, but he would die after the third door."

"Speaking of, are we just gonna brief him in the morning? Since he isn't here now."

"Yes, we literally agreed on that earlier, you amnesiac."

Kate smiled and yawned again. "Wow. And what if there's several vampires invading one house and we are outmatched?"

"I know enough about burglaries to say that it's twice as much required manpower and twice as many chances to get caught. If vampires have been around for years and they're still alive, they must have some experience doing this shit."

"Makes sense to me. Guess I am going to sleep. Happy birthday, sis, sleep tight." - Kate gave Vici a tender hug.

"Night-night. Thanks for being the best to me."

Next morning, the group got together to finalize the details of their plan, did some research on where the MurTruth office was located, calculated the best possible apartment block for the mission and departed for their destinations.

Victoria and Adrian arrived to a playground near an apartment block and took a seat on one of the benches, waiting for the signal from Kate. As it turned out, there was no MurTruth office: the news outlet was run entirely from the manager's home. The district looked a lot cleaner than most others they've visited before.

"I gotta say. I really miss the times when we used to sit together and watch whatever was available. Fruitnaz, the cliche 20th century animated films with the same story recycled over and over again, challenge run videos for games. It's like our ability to have fun has withered away." - Adrian confessed sadly, slowly spinning his phone with one hand.

She paused her quick typing. "That's not true. We're earning fat stacks, learning new things, protecting the children of this country, and the most important part, it's all legal. Soon, we'll have enough money to build our own underground drug empire and use the money to buy our way into the government, or we could just go through the legal route, focusing on expanding our skills, becoming legendary soldiers or operatives and eventually take over the military. There's so many options, but if we want to achieve any of them, we will need to work. Grind. Progress. Doesn't the end result inspire you to put in all the effort you can and replace your need to have fun?" - she asked with determination, looking at the clear white sky of the north. \*verify realism of white sky\*

"I want all that, and I am ready to put in the effort, and I know what we have to do to get ahead of everyone… But at the same, I don't feel like our interactions are filled with chilling and planning everything together anymore, like during the first week. Due to a discrepancy in our skills and abilities, we can't even be together on missions often anymore. Married adults probably know how to deal with that, but I am only learning how to be an adult."

Vici smiled. "I love how we're skipping the teen stage and jumping straight to adulthood. As shitty as adults are, at least the kind that raised us, teens are fucking weirder."

"Oh yes. I guess what I am trying to say is, I feel like I am losing you." - Victoria took a quick breath, put her phone in the left hand, reached for an ice maraca with the other before realizing that there's nobody around to use it on, looked at Adrian, then away, then put her right arm on a knee and leant on it, all in a span of only a few seconds. Her partner was alarmed, too, causing him to face Victoria. "I am sorry. I…"

"No, nonononononono. Don't be sorry. It's all good." - Vici said super quickly in a state of panic before taking a few long breaths to give herself time to compose herself. "Holy fuck. Okay. Okay. Do I understand correctly that we aren't spending enough time together and that makes you feel like you're losing me?" - she said at normal speed, still very tense.

Adrian's mouth opened for half a second, then closed again. "I..." - he looked away, then back, then away again. He closed his eyes, took a very deep breath and tried to say something again, but the only sound that came out was "A".

"If you're scared, calm down. I won't bite. I won't hurt you." - a notification came from Kate. Victoria turned off her screen and put it inside her dress before leaning back on her right hand. She took a few extra seconds to find the words after noticing that Adrian did not move or talk. "Look, I told you before. Whenever something is going wrong, proper communication is crucial to resolve whatever is happening. You clearly wanted to complain about something that was bugging you, and I guess I terrified you by becoming alarmed myself." - Vici put her hand on Adrian's shoulder. "But I was alarmed not because I am angry, but because I care and I want you to feel comfortable. Swallow whatever is causing you to freeze and try to confirm if I understand you correctly."

He took a deep breath with closed eyes again. "Yes. I think so." - Adrian finally replied.

"See, you got it. Don't forget to calm yourself down when you enter an extreme emotional state. Your enemies or your masters can and will exploit your emotions for their personal gains. Is not spending enough time with me the whole problem?" - Vici's voice became gentler while still sounding like she just outran a bear.

"Yes. Maybe, we can allot a couple hours every evening towards watching or playing something together?" - Adrian said with a neutral tone, still staring into the void.

"Doesn't need to be a couple hours. It can be every evening. Anything." - she gave Adrian another hug and gradually began accelerating her speech. "I don't want to lose you. I will do everything I can to keep you comfortable. Tell me what's wrong and I will rectify it. Just say what's wrong and it won't be." - Victoria began hyperventilating.

"Dude. Dude. I never said I wanted to leave you. Everything is okay. Nobody is leaving anyone. It's…" - but he couldn't find more words to say the same thing again but differently. Even though the situation was resolved, the shock remained and the dopamine boost from the resolution was completely overshadowed. He also heard a sniffle.

After recovering, they left the bench, entered the target apartment block and headed for apartment 128, taking the elevator and finally arriving at the door where they needed to go. Adrian rang the bell. There was no sound, or response. He rang again after a few seconds, pressing the button extra hard and repeatedly.

"I don't think it works. Might have broken it on purpose to make it so only authorized folk can arrive and complain." - Vici commented before pulling out a couple of ice maracas. "Too bad the door is metallic." - she began viciously banging on the door with them, eventually beginning to play the Fruitnaz opening sequence song on the door like on a drum.

After about 40 seconds, they heard a masculine-leaning muffled voice. "Hey, you're interrupting my work, you goddamn hooligans! If you have any complaints, send them on the official e-mail. Now get out of here before I send the footage of you disrupting me to the police."

"We are the police, dumbass. We're not gonna wait for you to read our email in 6 weeks. Open the door." - Adrian said, trying to mimic impatience.

"Last time I checked, the police doesn't allow 12 beer can tall folk in halloween costumes into the force. Now beat it."

"May wanna look through the glass eye thing on the door and open the door there, shitface. One more 'no' and that's obstruction of justice." - Vici pulled out both her Mind of Liberty and Murmansk Police Department cards and showed them through the door's peephole.

"Children in police \*and\* military? Did you steal or forge these cards?" - most of the irritation disappeared from the man's voice. "You know what, if you're so determined, come in. If you're lying, you've just committed several felonies on camera and the real cops will get you, plus the readers will appreciate the article." - a short-haired young adult opened the door. A lack of sleep deprivation in his eyes was plentifully compensated by his anxious movements. "Come in. How can I help you? Want some tea?"

The duo came in. The interior could be described as a complete and utter mess, filled to the brim with boxes, trash, reporter and white collar job equipment. Surprisingly, it didn't smell much. Adrian even saw the first real roach he has ever seen in his life, which he found amusing even if it did add more dread to the general atmosphere. Vici closed the door.

"No need, this won't take long. You know about vampires, right?"

"Of course. My superiors instructed me not to mention them in the news, though, and even when I could, I wasn't allowed to call them that. It made people paranoid to sleep in their homes, apparently. What, did the 'high command' order you to physically come to me to go back on that instead of the usual channel?" - he was wearing black pants and a green long-sleeved shirt.

"You're playing with fire, Mr. Passive Aggression, so shut up and listen: we need to set a trap to lure vampires into and intercept them this very night. That's where you come in: you're being tasked to write a fake article as quickly as possible about some celebrity family just having moved into the city, into Rosta district, into specific 4 apartments of one building. The modern security measures will not have arrived by tonight and they wouldn't have any bodyguards or servants working until late into the night, so it looks like free pickings. After you're done, send us a link to the article on a number we will provide you. Are you gonna be a good servant of the Fatherland and help us with these weirdos or are we gonna have to teach you how to respect authority?" - Vici stared at the man with a frown. Not too big to be theatrical, not too small to not convey emotion.

The manager took a deep breath. "Jeez. Maybe you two aren't lying after all. While a bit off, you talk similarly and use the same words. I'll help, even if this sounds way too obvious to work, but considering the order came from the central police AI, whatever you guys call it again, I guess I just don't know what I am doing." - he still sounded agitated and frustrated.

Victoria didn't anticipate for him to know about JusticeFrame, a massive NCAI (non-conscious AI; non-conscious stands for non-sentient) which collects information about all committed crimes, directs investigations, generates false evidence (only when asked) or informational assets (like the ones she was using herself in her hunt earlier) and generally just saves cops a lot of work so they could do more field missions and less bureaucracy, not counting the efficiency of handling complex investigations. Of course, it doesn't prevent all boredom, as some effort is still required to insert all collected data into the database, but according to her new colleagues, it's not even close to how much it took before. Lore dump aside, she quickly thought of a way to readjust the request accordingly without spilling the beans. "We were actually given pretty vague instructions on what to do, accidentally filling some gaps which were meant for you. The outside purpose of the article and the specific apartments to lure the vampires into were clearly designated, but the exact premise of the article wasn't."

"That makes more sense. Can you give me your number and the target apartments before I do what you need and get back to my other mountain of work which wouldn't be done until 4 in the night? Don't worry, I'll be fine. Just need some quadruple-shot espresso to get me through." - it was no longer obvious whether it was passive-aggressiveness or not anymore.

After giving the man the rest of the info, the duo left and ventured to the police station, holding hands as usual.

"That could have gone smoother." - Vici commented, typing Kate on her phone about their part of the mission being probably a success.

"I think I know what we can put on our gravestones."

"Heh. Yea."

A few silent tens of seconds passed. "You know. I did my best to resist making a joke about him asking for your number. I could have, but I felt like I'd just be further torturing the poor bastard." - Adrian smiled, turning his head away.

"Nice, that's a first for you. And yes, that'd just be mean for no reason. Anyone in his place would have taken it seriously." - Vici also smiled.

"You think? Speaking of, I am honestly okay with becoming a fellow predator child of child predators to help you with your work."

"I don't think I'll ever hear a cooler way to describe what I'm doing." - she said with mild amusement. "I'd need time to teach you how to do this. I don't know if they'll keep paying me as much moving forward. It'd be nice if they did, but sooner or later the results will wane when the dickheads get wary of their kin disappearing from civilian life. You sure it's worth it?"

"Can you teach me how to catfish in general? Sounds like an interesting skill."

"Always, love."

After working and an uneventful yet fun evening of watching videos and playing games on Adrian's bed, it was 23:04, nearing the time of the vampire hunt. They quickly made sure all their things were in order and left their apartment.

"Interesting, she's not waiting for us here either. Did she forget?" - Victoria asked with confusion.

"She always goes on these timed things ahead of time, sometimes unnecessarily. Is she already there?"

"No, we specifically agreed to meet up inside our homes. This is weird, I'm gonna see if she's home and grab her. Be right back." - she gave Adrian an affectionate shoulder tap.

"Okay."

After Adrian yawned and leant against a wall with closed eyes for a bit to ward off mild drowsiness, Vici came back, focused on something, and closed the door.

"You're looking pretty Kateless. Is she not there?" - he asked.

"She is. The problem is, she's sleeping like she's in a coma. And I'd feel bad if I awakened her, soooo…"

"Pfft. So irresponsible." - Adrian commented with audible sarcasm.

"We \*should\* be fine just by ourselves. Her role as a spotter was taken by our volunteers, and we should be able to handle combat on our own. It's unlikely that vamps have any natural resistances that would make them a problem."

"I guess if you say we're fine, then we're fine. Let's head out." - he turned towards the stairs.

"Whoa, no, that's not how we're doing it." - Adrian stopped and turned around, confused. "You can't just outsource all the thinking to me. Or suppress your fears about this going wrong just because I think we'll be fine. For many reasons. What do you actually think?"

"Dude, we're fucked without Kate. We don't know who we're dealing with. Why do you think we'll be fine?" - Adrian thought before deciding that he is now a badass, grown man and not a pussy. "Yea, we got this. Worst case scenario, we've got your flashlight, right?" - he asked with a fake, overacted smile. Or at least it felt overacted.

"Let's go then."

They made haste towards a bus which eventually took them near their destination. Adrian was only using one, half-closed eye to see where he was going, although Vici's hand helped too. He was eventually led to a 24/7 convenience store, where Victoria found a can of 9% Siberia 9 beer and approached the counter. There was only 1 other customer in the whole building.

"Ma'am, we don't serve alcohol to minors." - a confused middle-aged cashier with a small beard said, staring at the duo from a chair. Despite the time of day, he didn't look sleep-deprived.

"Ugh, we don't have time for this." - she pulled out her identity cards and showed them off.

The man looked at them with even more confusion. "I am not going to jail over this. You're gonna have to get one of your superiors to specifically tell me that you're buying it for them or this ain't gonna cut it."

Vici put away her cards and thought for a moment, eventually finding a container above the cashier which said "SMOKING KILLS" in red, "15% off!" in white underneath in a smaller font and "from 01.01.2091 to 07.01.2091!\*" underneath in an even smaller font. "Can you sell us your best cigs then?"

"We don't serve cigarettes to minors either. You sure you aren't looking for coffee instead?"

Adrian was just standing with closed eyes through the whole conversation, waiting for Vici to figure it all out. "I don't know. Is that the one that destroys sleepy feeling?"

"That's right. We have a coffee machine near the exit. You don't need alcohol in your lives. If adults can't manage alcohol properly, you probably wouldn't be able to, either." - despite the supportive tone, Adrian made an annoyed exhale, and Victoria frowned and turned around to check if there was a coffee machine.

There was one, and they went towards it after Vici gently nudged Adrian to turn around, and started looking at all the options on the touchscreen. There were options to add extra caramel, whipped cream, sugar, around 15 options for various drinks on top of what looked like a button for custom configuration, everything available in volumes 20 to 80 bottle caps, notably including hot chocolate. After recovering from that neuron activation, she realized she had no idea what she was looking for. "Do you know what's the densest kind we can pick?" - Victoria asked the cashier.

"Oh, you don't wanna go down \*that\* road. Pure espresso is dense enough for your needs. Just choose the 20 bcap option, any more and it might be too much. You also probably want to add max sugar so it goes down easier, just in case."

Vici nodded and picked everything according to the instructions and paid for the drink. "Hang in there. It won't be much longer."

"Thank fuck. I hate this." - Adrian answered, exhausted.

The machine made sounds for a bit. After it was done, she gently took the cup so as not to spill anything. Unfortunately, it was very, very hot. "Damn it, it's too hot to be drinkable. Wait, what if I…" - she rectified the problem by making an ice spoon from one of the ice maracas in her pockets and held it in for a bit before melting the ice into the trash. "Okay, done." - Adrian opened his eyes, took the cup and sniffed it. The smell was actually quite decent. He touched the coffee with his tongue, and it was a bit bitter, so he decided to drink it all at once, making two coughs afterwards. "Disgusting, right?"

"I… sort of like it. It has…" - he coughed. "...flavor. " - Adrian then noticed that the machine was working and there was a large cup in the output section. "Are you getting something? Thought there was only coffee here."

"Nope. I ain't leaving this place without a 80 bcap cup of hot chocolate." - Victoria stared at how her cup was slowly getting filled with a smile.

"Can I have some too?"

"From my cup, n-n-n-no. In general, yies." - that was sass by the way, not stutter.

After their drinks were done, they quickly walked towards the playground opposite of the target apartment block. They really didn't need to, as the signal from the local residents wasn't coming for hours. Neither of the children cared much: they had plenty of things to do.

Vicu was showing Adrian something on her phone. She was the one holding the phone instead of letting Adrian hold it directly, as his hands were too jittery for that earlier. "See, he compliments my personality. Perfect time to pull out the 'dad I've never had' card." - she typed something.

"Why not expr-press how much you love him already? He is already softly hitting on you." - Adrian said abnormally quickly before wiping sweat off his face.

"No normal child would say that this early. Sure, some psychopaths might be tempted to say that to a married neckbeard they barely know, but, again, the trick is to resemble an absolutely \*normal\* child. Maybe slightly more affectionate and vulnerable as usual, but not \*too\* much, and this \*is\* too much."

Adrian nodded 4 times very quickly. "Got it."

Victoria pointed with excitement at a new incoming message. "Oh, take a look. Take a look. He is offering to ship me a phone charger as a 'gesture of being grateful to know me' because I fake vented earlier about my current one being close to breaking. This is one of the biggest signs of success: he has decided that I am ready to take more advanced forms of grooming without being weirded out. It's not enough to incarcerate him, but at this point, you're locked in. You \*know\* you have a creep on the line, and the best part? He doesn't know \*you're\* the real predator here. But don't celebrate just yet, you need to finish the job."

"Oh, thhhhhank you so much! I have no words for how lovely you treat me. I really wish my dad was ran over by a car and you were my real d-dad." - Adrian said in a feminine voice.

She continued typing. "Good. Saying weird or awkward things is okay, you are meant to be a child after all, but make sure they're consistent with the personality you've established previously, and that you don't go too far off the rails. You don't want them to think you'll cut off their dick after they have their way with you." - Adrian's eyes widened for a moment. "Quirky, not yandere. Like here: I replied in several messages to give a genuine impression of a pleasant shock, which I \*can\* do, as I…" - a notification from one of the nearby apartments came up, after which the pair quickly got up and sprinted towards entrance 3. Adrian grabbed a magnetic key from his pockets to that section of the building, used it and went inside with Vici. The lock mechanism began beeping satisfyingly for a few seconds. Adrian stepped forward into a dirty entrance with mailboxes to the right, drew his sword, still sharpened from yesterday, and focused on trying to hear any footsteps, which he soon did. Victoria blocked off the exit button with ice. The floor was covered in a very dirty green carpet.

"You sure you're fine?" - she asked quietly, leaning against the metallic door and preparing a triple ice maraca in each hand.

"Of c-course." - Adrian stared forward with determination and focus, his ice sword facing diagonally downwards. He still felt a little jittery, even if his hands weren't shaking anymore.

The steps gradually became louder, until eventually a young adult man in a brown coat, dark green winter pants and a goofy blue hat with a pom-pom appeared from around the corner, hurrying somewhere, before abruptly stopping as soon as he saw the duo, staggering as a result. His face was obscured by a green scarf. "What the \*fuck\* am I looking at?" - he asked.

"You're under arrest, dickface. Hands behind your back." - Vici ordered impatiently.

The target shook his head. "Don't do this. It wasn't in my job description to kill \*children\*."

"Why won't you give yourself up and tell us about whatever you mean by 'job description'? We've committed several acts of police brutality already, fancy hat. It'd be \*very\* inconvenient if we killed you by accident."

The vampire sighed, pulled out a weird-looking dagger with his black thin gloves, pressed a button on the bottom, making its segments expand outwards, turning the weapon into a shortsword. "I am going to hell for this."

Adrian and the target charged one another while Victoria prepared an ice spear from 6 ice maracas to be thrown, waiting for a good window to hit him without missing. Adrian ducked under his adversary's initial grab attack and counterattacked by slashing his left leg. Despite Adrian's attempts to make distance, he was still in range for the vamp to push him forward with the knee of his other leg. Victoria used the distance made between them to finally throw a huge ice spear into the target's face, causing him to step back from the startle. The spear still landed on the chin and bounced off, forcing the vampire to gasp loudly as a result. By this point, Adrian has recovered from the last blow, so he dashed right at his opponent so he could slash the right side of his torso. The blow landed, but it was stopped by the thick coat. Adrian went for the second swing, which the enemy blocked. They held their swords crossed against eachother for a few moments before Adrian was pushed back so hard that he completely fell on his back. The target went for a stomp to capitalize, but another one of Vici's sextuple ice spears flew at him, which he decided to try to block with his left arm. Judging by the small grunt that followed, it was effective. Adrian rolled over to the side and jumped up before dashing forward, ducking and stabbing the vamp's right leg again. His sword went what felt like 8 apple seeds deep inside the leg. "Awgh", the target said with his teeth clenched, grabbed Adrian's right arm… And stabbed it through with his sword, causing him to scream viscerally, then again even louder when he pulled the sword out and shoved Adrian on the floor to the right.

Despite the shock, Vici managed to restore her focus within a few seconds. She knew she was next, and she knew her attacks didn't do nearly enough damage to incapacitate the vampire before he got close, but she had a different idea prepared for this scenario. Victoria assembled an ice panel from 2 pairs of ice maracas and held it by the handles in the back she conveniently made, assumed a stance in preparation to dodge and stepped forward. The enemy rushed down in her direction, but instead of attacking her, he sprinted to the sealed keypad and began trying to unsuccessfully unseal the button by trying to smash it, then pull on it. His lack of success and the mild stickiness of the ice sealing the button caused him to panic, giving Vici more time than needed to capitalize. Her second idea was to block off his face with ice, but since it was too high, she instead wrapped the ice sheet in her hands around his knees instead. It was a bit difficult due to the relatively big distance between them, but she succeeded through wrapping each knee in ice individually rather than wrapping both of them at the same time. The target tried to turn around, but he failed and fell on his chin instead, with not enough time to curb the fall with his hands. Somehow, it sounded like the impact was more painful than getting his leg stabbed. Victoria figured it was too dangerous to approach him due to his arms being perfectly free, but she had another ace up her sleeve, or specifically in her jeans underneath the skirt. She ran in front of him, pulled out her flashlight, squinted and turned it on on max power, pointing it at the vampire's face. He produced a moderate scream, dropping his sword and covering his eyes.

"Hands behind your fucking back or you'll be screaming 5 times louder than he did." - Vici also kicked him in the face once for good measure.

"Oke, ye, juss tenn et off!" - he asked, his speech distorted presumably from his jaw being broken. Instead of turning it off, Vici switched the flashlight power to the police-grade level, which was still very bright, but it was much less overwhelming for her eyes. The vampire complied and put his hands behind the back, allowing her to handcuff him with ice and finally run back towards Adrian after turning off the flashlight and putting it away.

Adrian was just sitting on the ground and watching the rest of the fight with intense joy on his face, using his left arm to lean against the floor. His right arm was just hanging vertically, blood dripping from it onto the carpet.

Victoria wasted no time removing his coat to observe the wound. "How are you feeling?" - she asked with a tone of cold focus.

"F-fucking awesome! I've never had so much fun in my l-l-life." - he took a deep breath. "You were so amazing over there. My right arm hurts like hell, though." - he answered with euphoria matching his expression and went back to hyperventilating. Vici deemed telling him that he is insane a waste of time which wouldn't help the situation. After fully removing the coat and closely examining the bleeding wound, she realized it wasn't just a big stab wound: it seemed like the sword was removed horizontally instead of the same way it was inserted, causing the wound to look like Adrian's arm had been half-cut off. It looked like the blood stained Adrian's shirt too as it was going down his arm onto the ground. For some reason, the volume of blood lost per second wasn't the same all the time: it was less, then more, then less again. "Kinda wish my whole arm w-was dismembered instead. The way it's dangling now makes it feel even worse." - he laughed.

"I doubt that'd be \*less\* painful."

She searched her other pockets designated for non-ice maracas for bandages, but they were nowhere to be found. Adrian's pants and coat didn't have any either. Vici took a split second to check on the cuffed vampire to see if he was still on the ground, and he was. She then took a deep breath and shut the arm back and sealed the wound with ice.

"Eh… Ehhhh… Why…" - Adrian asked in even more pain than earlier.

"We forgot the damn bandages at home. It's this, or bleeding to death. I'm sorry." - Victoria sat down near Adrian and started calling someone on her phone. "I hope emergency services work at 2:24."

She put the call on the loudspeaker and waited for 911 to answer. The call was picked up, but instead of the hotline operator, everyone heard Kate's dad calmly say, "I assume it didn't go well?"

"Oh, f-fuck, we're busted." - Adrian said in a voice strained from pain.

"Not necessarily, we don't even know what happened. We'll sort everything out, just let me know if we can come in."

"Wait, so let me get this straight. This whole time you had the power to intercept any call ever, but you need us to open the door from the inside?" - Vici asked in surprise.

"Oh, no, we can do both. The door mechanism is hundred year old technology, and there is a backdoor for maintenance and whatnot. Just don't want you to shoot us by accident in case you stole any firearms for this."

"We didn't steal anything. Come in."

The same beeping as earlier happened, and both of her caretakers came in and started observing what happened. Victoria stood up and turned towards the mailboxes away from everyone and began staring into nothing with her hands behind her back.

"Can't believe this was all a part of a controlled environment. We weren't even in any danger." - Vici said, empty inside.

Kate's mom approached Adrian, squatted near him and began observing him. "We can't have you die on us. We did our best not to intervene. Are you okay, Adrian?"

"Sort of. Arm alm-almost cut off. Please b-bandage it properly." - he asked.

"Bandages alone won't do enough. You're lucky she saved you with that ice, otherwise we'd probably need medical resurrection to bring you back, which is both expensive \*and\* would leave you brain damaged like Jason. You're gonna have to come to ER with us to unseal the wound when the doctors ask you to, Victoria."

"Sure. I still have a few hours before my natural sleep kicks in." - Victoria shrugged.

"I assume he is the vampire which fell for your little trap?" - her husband asked, observing the man on the ground. Vici nodded. "It's an impressive scheme for your first time. JF probably never considered it as you weren't deemed experienced enough to pull off something like this, and probably because it didn't assume they would be stupid enough to fall for something this obvious. Seems like it was wrong on both counts. This \*was\* a very fruitful exercise of your applied intelligence, and capturing a vampire would certainly help the investigations immensely, but next time, try to coordinate things like this with us, alright?"

"Fine by me. As long as we get to have that fancy sword."

"We'll need to analyze it as evidence, but after we're done, you can have it. It's a marvel of Chinese engineering, and this one's made of advanced compounds so it can remain durable. A genuine blade like this should net you a few tens of thousands of bears if you decide to sell it."

\*make adrian more adrenalined, and add a line about vici admiring her new sword\*

They swiftly brought the catch and the sword to the police station, and the children to a hospital. On her way there, Vici kept thinking why the boxes weren't outside, which kinda defeated their whole point. When they arrived, Adrian's wound had been successfully treated through conventional means and Victoria was driven back home.

One day and two nights later, Kate arrived at the hospital to pay Adrian a visit. He was sitting on the metallic chairs near the entrance and playing something with his left hand. His other arm was gone. When Adrian noticed Kate approaching, he turned off his phone's screen and went forward to embrace her. "Heyyyyyyyy." - they both said at the same time.

"Man, it's weird being one-armed. It's really challenging to do some of the most basic things. It's sort of fun, though, minus the damn phantom pain." - they took a seat on the chairs, Kate to the left of Adrian.

"You just can't help but to stay positive about these things, can you?" - Kate smiled, trying to detect any sarcasm.

"Yea, well, I do miss you guys, and everything else honestly, even tho Vici and Matt are doing their best to still spend time with me remotely. At the same time, you have no idea how much adrenaline having your arm cut off gives you, it's a feeling to behold." - Kate was further alarmed by a lack of any signs of sarcasm. "And I don't have to go to school. And now they know we can handle real jobs which risk or involve combat, even if not emergency calls just yet. Well, they let \*you\*. Sounds like you're all hoarding all the fun from me." - he shook his head slowly.

"You're not wrong about that." - Kate smiled again. "What about, you know. Losing your human arm?"

"Oh, good riddance, honestly." - Adrian began whispering. "They're gonna give me a hoptrooper arm. I don't know why, but I sure as shit ain't questioning it."

"I meant… Nevermind." - she hoped she would never need to have her arm amputated and replaced with a bionic. "What's a hoptrooper?"

"Oh, right. Apparently, it's a supersoldier-class unit designed for urban combat, and they hop around from building to building with top-notch bionics, mostly annihilating the enemy with explosions but they can also hunt down other hoptroopers and do other cool stuff."

"The battlefields must be \*violent\*. Hope if I'm becoming a proper soldier, I'm becoming a super one from the get go."

"They might let you. Don't see why wouldn't they. Personally, I wouldn't wanna be a million alligators near these meatgrinders, but you do you."

A few moments of silence have passed. Kate laid back on the chair. "I still can't believe you two did this whole operation on your own without letting me partake. I love how caring and considerate you two are, but also, please wake me up next time I forget." - she requested cheerfully.

Adrian turned his head away and pretended to think about something to seem casual. "Yea, sure thing."

At that moment, Kate felt something icy touching her neck from behind. She gasped for air, quickly turned her head sideways, and, well, of course it was Vici with an ice stick near her who was laughing from the reaction. Adrian could resist either, and neither could Kate herself. "You never wanted to check out the tall slide on the way, did you?"

"Oh, I did. I'll give it a few goes on the way back too. I just couldn't squander the opportunity to make you scream. Wait, that came out wrong." - Victoria covered her mouth and continued laughing.

Kate joyfully nodded quickly several times. "Yea, no shit it came out wrong, you psycho."

"You're the one to talk after punching a dude in the face during an interrogation for no reason." - Vici took a seat to the right of Adrian as he enjoyed the serene, inspiring chaos of another one of their arguments.

"He was trying to ethically justify increasing the army enrollment age to 16! Children get oppressed enough in our society as is, and he wanted to strip us of our basic rights to serve our country? He was evil, and he got what he had coming!" - Kate flailed her hands aggressively, like she was playing an invisible accordion and making other agitated hand movements.

"Yea, except your task was to non-violently extract information, not punish him, and you allowed your emotions to cloud your judgement and fail the task."

Victoria put her left hand on the armrest next to Adrian. He looked at it and said, "Uhhhhhhh…" before both of them burst into laughter.

Vici's laughter was muted and strained from discomfort. "Oh n-no."

"Well, they told me… Why are you two laughing, like I missed something?" - Kate missed any of it.

"She gave me a hand, bro. Just couldn't resist the temptation." - Adrian elaborated, still laughing.

"I swear to Christ, that was purely out of habit." - Vici defended herself, also lightly laughing to mask embarrassment.

"Oh, come on. You told me yourself that dark humor is great for making misery less miserable. Why do you suddenly feel bad about this?"

"She said what now?" - Kate side-eyed Victoria.

"You wouldn't get it, Kate." - she took a deep breath. "I don't know, Adrian. You're right, but it feels so mean." - she turned her head away sadly. "I guess I still haven't recovered from the shock of… you know. You say you're fine, but what if you're just forcing yourself to think and say that to soften the impact?" - a few seconds of silence passed as Adrian tried to think of a comforting answer. "Maybe you \*are\* fine and maybe it \*is\* just me."

"Either way, did you wanna swap places?" - Kate switched topic.

"No need. There's always option B." - she wrapped her hand around Adrian's back. They leant against eachother as much as the two armrests could allow. "They're releasing you next evening, right?"

"That's right. The arm should arrive this evening and need a day for the calibration afterwards. One more week after that and it should begin feeling like I was born with it, if you don't count the strength." - Adrian explained.

"Is it that easy? I would have thought the adjustment would be a little more difficult." - Kate asked.

"Nah, this technology was invented back when Putin was still kicking. There was more than enough time to streamline the integration on the user's end."

"Anyway, Mr. Bionics Nerd, got some news for you. I am not sure \*you\* heard it, actually, Mrs. Loves-Solving-Problems-By-Punching-People-In-The-Face." - Victoria announced. She felt safe to explain this, as there weren't much people around.

"Oh my god, shut up! You're literally a professional torturer yet you still laugh at me for punching an asshole in the face for being an asshole." - Kate commented playfully.

"Except I…" - Vici wanted to bring up doing what she's asked to without failure unlike Kate, but that also felt too mean. "Except I only punch people in the face when I need to. Well, my equivalent of punching."

"It's called being human, Vici. You wouldn't understand."

Her talking speed started to accelerate. "And do you seriously think smashing someone's pretty face will make them change their mind? No, it will make them feel oppressed for their opinion, painting themselves as a martyr whose superior opinion is being suppressed by the stupid masses. That dude probably just had this opinion as a side thought, and now he's gonna write a book in the gulag about why we should increase enrollment age to 18, if not outright 21. Is that really what you wanted to accomplish?"

"That's a nice argument, sister. Why won't you back it up with a \*source\*?" - Kate asked, agitated.

"As much as I love listening to you two launching drone swarms at one another, what's the news you're talking about?" - Adrian had to interrupt.

"Right. Basically, Vasiliy and I interrogated the vampire we caught on that day. Our good cop bad cop dynamic was complete overkill. Turns out, he wasn't a vampire at all, just a hired thug, sent to try to collect something from the locations in the news. They didn't risk sending a real vamp as they suspected the news article to be fabricated, so they sent this desperate fucker to check it out." - Vici explained, decelerating her speech and talking quieter.

"Who are these vampires, anyway? Some sort of a gang, actual fantasy vampires or just weirdos?" - Kate asked in a somewhat frustrated voice. She kept changing her pose every couple seconds, like she couldn't find a good position to sit in.

"It's a mix of all three. They're some sort of replicants who need blood to function. If they don't receive said blood… Well, I presume they die or go insane, or something. He wasn't told that part."

"So they don't have much choice and they're not an edgy blood cult. Anything about their numbers? Broader plans?" - Adrian asked.

"We have no idea. JF estimates they're anywhere from 200 to 2000 strong. As for broader plans, we have no idea, but one thing they are apparently very adamant on is non-aggression, as insane as that sounds. JF and most cops think that's just whitewashing, but if that's true, that's some inhumanly amazing and well-thought out whitewashing, not the kind I am used to."

"Invading people's homes to steal their blood and occasional murders don't seem too non-aggressive to me." - Kate shrugged.

"I am just using that word to simplify the situation, it definitely doesn't fit the definition. Fancy hat was adamant that they only ever fight in self-defense during burglaries, to the point where he sounded annoyed by it. Said he was constantly reminded that his reward would be halved if he killed anyone on the job unprovoked. Not saying that was actually what happened, but I feel like it's important to keep an open mind in this crazy ass city."

"I agree. Pacifist vampire gangsters is an \*insane\* concept, but it's far from impossible, I imagine. Even if not all of this is accurate. That's very cool." - Adrian noted.

"It is. Anyway, is that it, or can we go back to the previous discussion?" - Kate asked quickly and impatiently.

After the girls went away, the rest of Adrian's hospital stay went according to plan, and he was granted a new right arm along with a new right shoulder the same evening. He chose not to put any artificial skin on the arm as it looked cooler that way in his opinion, and he didn't regret it. The arm calibration was done before 18 of the following day, yet he was still released only shortly after 21 because of logistics or bureaucracy, he didn't really understand exactly why. On the day after that, after being requested to skip school so he had further time to adjust to his newfound strength, he picked up Vici after school and they went to a nearby playground with some basic exercise equipment.

"Alright there, Mr. Grivus. I remember you're strong enough to lift yourself up with one arm on one of those high parallel bars to level your shoulder with the bar 3 to 4 times before getting exhausted on a good day. If you can't level your waist with the bar like that, I think it's reasonable to ask for a refund." - she commented sarcastically when they arrived.

"Realistically, it should be strong enough for that. Here we go.." - Adrian approached the equipment piece, grabbed the top bar with his new right arm and lifted himself up, leveling his waist with the bar with no issue, and began holding himself up there for a while.

"So it wasn't a scam."

Adrian got back down and began going up and down over and over. "Yep. Hurts my back a bit, for some reason. And what I am assuming are spots where the shoulder is connected with the rest of the body. I guess I can't complain considering I am still learning the controls, so to speak.." - he stopped and turned around. Somehow, he wasn't sweaty at all. "Wanna see me try to stand on my hand like a Chinese cartoon protagonist?" - he asked gleefully.

"Absolutely not. You'll fall and die." - Victoria smiled black.

"Okay, \*mom\*."

"Who do you think you're calling 'mom'? Come here." - she dared playfully and took a few intimidating steps towards Adrian.

"Oh god, no, no! Not \*mom\*. I never called you that." - he began walking back and crossing his hands in front of his chest.

"That's right. Call me that again and you'll have sores from finger stabs."

"Alright, alright. I think I saw this one bodybuilder guy who stood on his hand, but horizontally instead of vertically. Is that safe enough for you, auntie?"

Vici just giggled intensely in response. "Not auntie, bro."

"I'll take that as a yes." - he found a flat, non-icy spot on the ground and began trying to position himself properly. Something snowless would have been preferable, but it covered everything as far as eye could see.

Adrian took a few tries to assume the same position he saw in the video and began trying as Vici watched in amusement. For like ten seconds before beginning to stare at the white northern sky and thinking about life. \*verify realism of white northern sky\* Eventually, Adrian gave up and stood back up. "Still not a ripoff?"

"I think this one requires balance aswell as raw strength. I doubt it's something I can do without any practice whatsoever. Here's something else." - he picked up a football.

"Try not to kill anyone. I don't wanna come up with arguments afterwards for why giving an 11 year old ramazon a hoptrooper-grade bionic is a good idea." - Vici jabbed with an affectionately playful tone.

"I gotcha." - he looked at an apartment block nearby, threw the ball with a left hand into the air and punched it with full force of his right. It didn't pop from the initial swing, allowing it to fly at insane speeds towards a black metal bar of a window on the fourth floor and popped very loudly. A chunk of the ball fell on a random car with a comically loud thud, triggering its beeping alarm.

"Wow, they don't build these balls to handle a mega fisto puncharu. Pathetic. And now look at what you've done, you just stripped some kids from being able to play football until one of their parents orders another one online, all because you wanted to have some fun and test out your new toy. You should be ashamed of yourself." - do I even need to mention this was sarcastic?

Adrian shrugged in response. "Also about us having a weird vendetta against cars for some reason. It's like we're racist against cars."

"I think that's normally called 'passionate about racing'. You know, when you see a car and can't think of anything other than wanting to race one." - Adrian laughed slightly. "You don't have to laugh if you don't find it funny." - Victoria smiled at him.

"Oh, okay."

"Well, I didn't mean just like \*that\*." - she said, not actually upset, at least audibly.

This time, Adrian laughed entirely genuinely. "What did you mean?"

"Nevermind. I'll just need to try harder is all." - Victoria turned away, still smiling.

"You know, I've noticed you're a lot more happy around me ever since yesterday. Did something happen?"

Vici started walking around aimlessly, staring at the ground. "I am just happy to see you're happy, that's all. When he stabbed and unintentionally infected your arm, I was shocked. It's one thing to see myself get hurt, but it's completely different when I need to worry about someone else's pain." - she looked at the sky. "But I have nothing to be shocked about. You're as happy as you've ever been, aren't you?"

"That about sums it up. And even if it was bad, do you think I'd give up trying to move up in the world with you together? Hell nah." - Adrian shrugged again.

"That's exactly what I wanted to hear." - Vici smiled, turned towards Adrian and positioned her right hand up for a high five.

He accepted the invitation for a high five. "To human misery!"

"Aw, fuck." - Victoria yanked her hand backwards and started blowing at it. It was red from impact.

"I am sorry, are you okay?"

"I've been worse…"

"It's like a high-sensitivity joystick. Really easy to overshoot it with your strength."

"Do you have a limiter? You're dangerous." - despite Vici being in pain, she made that sound something between amused and flirtatious.

"Didn't think it'd be necessary. In hindsight, I should have known better."

S2E8 Thinking Ceases, The Truth Is Lost

Adrian and Kate were practicing their marksmanship in an abandoned factory somewhere on the edge of Murmansk. They've assembled a range around 3 alligators long, using recycled rubber salvaged from trash dumps both as targets and backgrounds, empty shelves found around the factory, tape, and some sort of a metallic frame for blocking potential dangerous ricochets, in case not enough was done to prevent them from happening otherwise. The factory in general was mostly stripped of anything valuable before they arrived, so most of what remained was giant rusty machines of unknown purpose, industrial staircases, elevated platforms, structural beams, doors beyond repair, and generally just pieces of metal all over the floor, presumably remnants of larger objects. The winter light of Murmansk seeping through the giant windows illuminated how filthy the whole building was, and the children's sentiments about it ranged from being mildly disgusted to charmed. Victoria was sitting very high up on one of the platforms, overlooking her friends and doing something on her phone as usual, legs hanging through the railings.

Kate and Adrian kept shooting all 12 targets one by one, changing the order every time in a spontaneous pattern. "I just keep getting worse and worse! Earlier, I was getting 2 to 4 misses on average. Now I missed 7 times, that's more than half a magazine." - Kate complained with intense frustration. She was wearing a protective helmet as she had zero confidence ricochets still couldn't happen and holding the pistol with two hands.

Adrian finished up his current magazine. "Maaaaaaaaaaybe trying to do this side by side wasn't such a great idea." - he was only using his new arm, and he was wearing the exact same blue hat with a pom-pom as the burglar from around a month ago. It was meant to be a funny joke to last only a couple of days, but Matt loved the dissonance between the hat and Adrian's general persona so much that he convinced Adrian to just keep wearing it outside of serious situations.

"No, I love that we grow together, but I can't help but keep looking at how you're doing, and you seem to barely ever miss. What are your results so far?" - she did her best to seem less pissed off.

"Just got my second perfect score. I miss around one shot on average from what it feels like, but I've been getting better since we started today. Just needed some time to focus, I guess." - Adrian was audibly high on adrenaline. "But try to resist comparing yourself to me. I have a \*bit\* of an unfair advantage."

"I just can't help myself. How am I meant to become a legendary deadshot if I can't hit half my shots under minimum pressure?"

"Whoa there, Batman." - Vici spoke with a megaphone on a low setting, which was borrowed from the police. There was a sizable surplus of them, and she was half-sure the cops knew she took one and just didn't care. She didn't actually need it to be heard, it was all for style points. "You can't just get depressed. That's \*our\* thing and you ain't stealing it from us. Eyes on the prize and focus on the moment. Cover Adrian's side with something to obscure the view and race against yourself, even if he is physically around." - Adrian nodded in approval.

Kate put the safety on, spun the pistol around her right index finger a few times for good measure and put it away. "Maybe. I guess I just need to take this one step at a time."

A cloud of pungent smoke reached Adrian's face. He coughed a couple of times, stepped away, faced where it came from and began scratching his face. "Jason, what the fuck, bro?" - he put away his pistol too.

Jason was smoking a cigarette. By this point, he also had a holster with a pistol attached to his belt. "Don't worry, it's not harmful." - he reassured in an extra deep, raspy tone. "Just a prescription med."

"Why does it smell like rotten eggs with perfume then? It even makes my eyes tear up." - Kate said in a strained voice while stepping far away from Jason and the smoke clouds and began wiping her eyes with gloves.

"Remember what you've been told about drugs and suicide, Jason. It's never the answer, unless your commanding officer tells you it's the answer, in which case, go ahead and charge headfirst into certain death while high on meth." - Victoria couldn't help herself. "You're the one to talk." - Kate quickly shut her mouth with both hands after about a second. Adrian was about to say something similar, so he was relieved it wasn't \*him\* who said something at the wrong time for once.

"Oh, for fuck's sake, Kate, not you too. Well you can't unsay that now, my point has been completely ruined. And what kind of a demented, psychotic crackhead of a doctor would prescribe tobacco to an 11 year old? Not even my therapist from 4 years ago was this insane, and let me tell you, that's a hell of a statement."

"Don't worry, guys. It's just cat fur. It's not harmful, it's just a natural remedy to help me think better." - Jason explained with an extra strained voice before intensely coughing. "It's really… shit coming in… but it helps my brain cells' regrowing."

"I guess it's fine if it's prescribed? Just, please don't smoke around us. This is horrible, I have no idea how you're smoking this." - Adrian further stepped away from Jason's smoke clouds.

Jason extinguished the cigarette with his tongue, gagged, spit under a window and threw the cigarette in the same place. "Yea, we don't want your 'healing', no thank you." - Kate agreed.

"Of course. I understand if you don't like the smell. It's hard to get used to." - Jason coughed again.

Kate noticed that Victoria was doing something in her phone again. "Look at you up there. Back to catfishing while we're getting the…"

"The authentic Osventsim experience?" - Adrian dropped.

Jason just looked at him, confused, while Kate facepalmed with an audible slap. "Noooo!"

Victoria spoke without a megaphone this time, smiling. "Oh, come on, Kate. We're raised to kill, civilians included, and we can't even make quasi-humorous comparisons with historical mass murder? Get real. Don't give me those squinted eyes, you know damn well that laws of warfare are guidelines and not actual laws." - and then she realized this wasn't the best place to say that. "Not saying it's \*okay\* if they order us to exterminate an ethnicity, but we'll all probably be ordered to kill a few civilians, even if it won't necessarily be a specific ethnos. The news don't even hide that we kill civilians with our carpet bombing and drones and shit."

Adrian felt pleasantly reassured. "And it's not like we defend it or anything. Of course, there's always a possibility a nazi gets elected president and-"

"Now, now, now, we'll handle the dilemma of choosing between becoming traitors in the short run or war criminals in the long run if and when we get there. No use wasting energy thinking about that now." - Vici said to protect her group from any excessive overthinking. They've certainly overthought enough for one discussion, the way she saw it. "Anyway, we're getting a little off-course. I found something alarming, let me come down and show you." - she stood up, grabbed her phone and megaphone and began going down the long industrial staircases. As she went down, a large group of talking teenagers in leather jackets and spiked armbands entered the factory, looked at Adrian visibly readying to draw his pistol and staring into their souls for a few seconds and promptly left without a word.

The gang from the lab congregated around Victoria, and she began talking even before reaching the bottom of the stairs. "I found it weird that the smoke was described to smell like rotten eggs, and I \*was\* half-right. It \*is\* meant to smell this bad, but it's also very toxic and absolutely not considered valid medication. You sure you didn't mix it up with anything?"

"Nope. They told me it was the only way I could ever heal." - Jason answered. It felt like his tone of voice changed permanently to be sickly and low-pitched.

"I found a few posts online, claiming a certain charity organization called The Healing Paw sold their terminally or simply severely ill loved ones cat fur cigarettes to smoke. The comments had some of the most crackheaded discourse I've seen in my \*life\*, but that's beside the point."

"Yes, they both prescribed and sold them to me. They said the government and big pharma are hiding how effective their usage is. That they're trying to suppress every mention of this and rewrite databases. I mean, it sounded real."

"Well, it's obviously not! Doesn't take a professional hustler like Vici to know this is a load of crap." - Kate looked at Victoria. "I still can't believe you only lasted about 3 weeks actually cleaning up society before moving on to catfishing legit people. Old habits die hard, don't they?"

"Hey, man, we've managed to stay under the radar for this long, despite getting JF directly involved in generating material and alt accounts for us to abuse. The way I see it, we deserve the extra money. And besides, it's not our fault our work got outsourced. But we're getting sidetracked again, I'm gonna call JF and see what it knows about Healing Paw. There might be a big paycheck waiting for us at the end because this sounds \*highly\* illegal." - Vici dialed up JF and put it on loudspeaker. The time on her phone showed 19:39.

"How can I help you?" - a pleasant, slightly sped-up masculine voice asked.

"You forced JF to use the voice of Gloccoli from Fruitnaz when talking to you?" - Kate said, laughing. Both Adrian and Victoria smiled. "Why didn't I think of that? Can you speak to me in Lemmy's voice?"

"For security reasons, please repeat the request when calling from your-"

"Your mobile device, yea, whatever. Forgot you have security measures against AI voice impersonation, even though only \*you\* have access to AI voices in the entire country along with the military. Ugh." - all the joy in Kate's voice was gone and replaced with frustration.

"Let's get to the point. Jason claims to have been prescribed and sold cat fur cigarettes by The Healing Paw. What have you got on them? Pretty sure that's illegal on several counts." - Victoria asked JF.

"Correct. There have been hundreds of similar and identical reports, even some where minors were allegedly falsely prescribed and sold such items. When police went to verify the reports, sometimes they found the buildings where transactions allegedly took place empty, sometimes the building was reported to lack any Healing Paw personnel, and so on." - Vici grinned and shook her head slowly. "On top of that, several individuals associated with the organization have been successfully arrested and incarcerated for distributing homemade fur cigarettes. However, both them and their higher-ups claimed they acted independently, and the reports may have been a part of a decentralized defamation campaign, so the evidence is inconclusive. If you have any additional evidence, bring it to your assigned police station whenever possible, and order Jason to stop using said medication immediately."

"I'm fine, I won't do it anymore. Jeez." - Jason reassured, annoyance somewhat noticeable through the raspiness of his voice.

"Sounds like we've got an intriguing game of cat and mouse on our hands, bois. These aren't your ordinary scam artists, this is a professional syndicate which sells people lung cancer and convinces them it's good for their health. Don't know about you two, but the two of \*us\* are bringing the whole thing \*down\*. Right?" - a fire the likes Adrian has never seen before sparked in Victoria's eyes.

"Damn right. Let's teach them what happens when you fuck with the Corks Crew!" - Adrian was also excited to partake in the investigation. The Corks Crew was an unofficial group which included him, Adrian, Kate, and on rare occasions, Jason. He tried his best to make everyone else use the name too, mainly because he was really, really proud of the pun.

"That's the fucking spirit, sis! I don't care that we're biting above our weight, I am in by default." - Kate punched the air downwards with determination.

"Same with me, I am also… down." - Jason coughed. "I really should have researched any medication I'm taking in detail before using it. I can't believe I had to bear all this for nothing."

"Please, only go to reputable doctors from now on. Ideally, ask your parents to find them for you, you're putting too much needless pressure on yourself. Oh, and you can't assist the investigation. Based on your voice, you need to get to a hospital right away. I'll notify your parents so they can come and pick you up." - JF said.

"Man, not again." - he said with disappointment and coughed once more.

Jason and Adrian's dad came by shortly, picked up all 4 children in a police car and drove Jason to a hospital. Kate called shotgun and nobody objected. Nobody questioned if using a police car for this purpose was allowed, as everyone was used to the military telling the police what to do by this point.

"You know, I just realized something. Adrian, what voice are you using for JF?" - Kate asked.

"Oh, it's Pickolt. Also from Fruitnaz." - Adrian replied.

"Oh my god, Vici, you still haven't forgotten Glaprikolt and you're spreading it again? Are you for real…?" - her words became quieter and quieter until she couldn't talk anymore because of laughter.

Adrian tried to analyze whatever the fuck were they talking about. "You damn fucking well know I \*am\*. You remember how emotionally invested I was in it." - Victoria said quickly. "I didn't care. You could have all… abandoned me… and I still would have… kept… um…" - the playfulness in her speech was gradually replaced with emptiness as she began staring into the car floor somewhere. Kate abruptly stopped laughing.

Adrian grabbed her by the shoulders and began shaking her. "Snap out of it! Snap out of it! Everything is fine now. Noone will leave you again. You're with friends now."

"Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Everything is fine. It's all good." - Vici shook her head quickly and forced a smile to convince herself it was all good. "Fruitnaz, yes."

Adrian followed through with the rest of the standard procedure for events like this, which included a hug and a few headpats. Jason just ignored all of it, staring into the window and looking at the snow. "Yes, Fruitnaz. Now, what's this Gapricot you guys were talking about?"

"It's Glapri-kolt. It's the name for my ship of Gloccoli, Apricute and Pickolt."

"Oh. Oh! That's what it's called. I don't know why you were the only believer before, the evidence you've provided is \*pretty\* irrefutable."

"I know, right? It wasn't intended, but at the same time, it doesn't not make sense."

\*they talk about it for a bit\*

"Well, I never \*was\* a normal child. But one day the girls started talking about how they wished pairs of characters were together. Lemmy and Melly, Jinnger and Starsnip, well I wanted a \*throuple\*. I was always wondering why whenever marriage involved more than 2 people, it always \*had\* to be exploitative and unequal, so this was my time to shine."

Adrian had a couple of related things to say, but he didn't feel like saying them with his dad around. "Kate, is everything okay down there?" - he asked and looked at the interior mirror.

She was also looking outside the window. "Yea, yea, I'm fine. Just got… distracted."

Adrian and Vici were dropped off near their home, and Kate - near her police station, so she could drop off Adrian's pistol along with her own for the night, deliver the cigarettes and log the incident. \*man i am unsure of this grammar\*

The following day at school, while Kate being plentifully entertained by her work as a self-appointed hallway monitor, Vici was calmly making hypothesises on how the job was gonna go. Thankfully, an expensive candy box handpicked by Adrian and words of assurance towards the principal allowed the trio to smuggle phones into school and use them out of everyone's sight during school breaks, so she could still find something to watch with him to distract herself from exploring the vast web of possibilities of investigating The Healing Paw. Kate also insisted Vasil would be allowed in on the deal, even though he also preferred monitoring hallways and beating up any bullies they could find. The principal didn't feel like sharing the privilege with \*all\* of the new immigrants from the lab, but Brian, one of the latest arrivals, successfully managed to bribe his way into the deal independently. The main trio didn't doubt even for a second that the miniature copper replica of the Statue of Liberty he used as leverage either wasn't purchased legitimately (or purchased at all).

After school was finally over, Kate, Victoria and Adrian found a deserted nearby playground, took a seat on one of the benches and signaled Vici to call up JF with a nod.

"We're ready to roll, bitch. What have you got on the DNA analysis of the cigs?" - she asked.

"There wasn't enough time to even begin the DNA analysis. However, the deconstruction revealed similar results to other examples: shredded fur mixed with herbs soaked in cheap aromatic oils with added sweeteners. However, every captured sample always seems to have slightly different details: the fur type, specific herbs, sweeteners and oils used, their manufacturers and exact types, distribution, wrapping and coloring." - Kate laid back and began exploring the idea of synthesizing all music genres imaginable into one while staring at the sky, half-paying attention to JF. "The inconsistency implies they could be either homemade or assembled in different factories with intentionally different exact recipes to throw me off, both perfectly likely. Interestingly, most of the time fur wasn't the only compound which produces toxic fumes when burnt, with used oils and plants sometimes also being unsuitable for usage in cigarettes. Whoever is making these clearly doesn't care about the consumers' health."

"Hmm… When you said 'type of fur', you meant color or animal species?"

"Both."

"What animal species were the processed samples so far?"

"Just cats and dogs."

"Common domestic animals." - Adrian noted.

"Either way, what's our plan on further investigations? Did Jason say where he bought the cigs?" - Vici asked.

"Yes. However, driving there risks alerting them that they're being investigated, even if you're not wearing your police clothes. Instead, two of you will go to the apartment connected to the phone number which pitched and sold the cigarettes to Jason, and two more of you will visit the abandoned bakery where Jason agreed some friends would pick up the order for him this time. Remember, you'll be looking for any evidence to connect The Healing Paw to fur cigarette sales." - JF ordered.

Adrian squinted. "There's only 3 of us, bro. Get your math straight." - Victoria noticed.

"It \*is\* straight. Vasiliy has agreed to join you."

"What? When?" - Adrian asked, confused.

"Oh yea! This just gets better and better. Wait, what are we talking about?" - Kate asked, back from her unrelated train of thoughts.

"Either way, while I would have \*preferred\* to legally barge into someone's home, I'm definitely gonna perform better if me and Adrian take the bakery. I've also got a plan, JF." - Vici said the last line in a cowboyish accent. It has vastly improved since last time.

"What's the plan?" - JF asked.

Vici explained her plan and what she needed. Adrian made an amused face and nodded in approval. "That's the most Vici thing I've ever goddamn heard." - Kate commented, smiling.

"That \*is\* an interesting approach, but it's easier than what I had planned, so you can go ahead." - JF approved. They clarified a few other moments before JF directed the group to wait at a bus stop for Vasil with the guns they left at the police station yesterday.

While waiting, Vici was still chatting with her matches on dating apps and emotionally manipulating them into giving her money in various ways. To adapt to her new young adult alternate personas, she tricked JF into generating pics of 15 year old girls which looked old enough to pass as adults. Even if not every pic passed perfectly, it's not like the AI moderation could do anything: the accounts themselves had the appropriate ages, and since shown age read Cheburnet ID, in the eyes of the automod nothing was off. Adrian was doing the same thing, but with less simultaneously used accounts and with less success. He still was good enough to bring plenty of stress and despair to Oroborovsk's citizens and earn relatively negligible but otherwise great amounts of money. He picked the Omnislavia's second largest city as a target to have a different pool of victims from Vici. Don't blame them too hard, it's the only way they knew how to spend their lives. \*editor please let me know if my trauma is seeping through too hard here lmao\*

"Since we'll be busy with our part, can you yoink a few expensive things for me from that apartment that noone would notice missing?" - Victoria asked Kate with an excited smile.

She shook her head and also smiled. "Never in a million years."

"Pwetty pwease?" - Vici tried asking in a high-pitched tone, taking a second to pause chatting to try to look Kate in the eyes with a childish expression.

"N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no."

Victoria went back to a normal tone, shrugged and looked at Adrian. "Well, I tried. Seems like we're gonna have to break into a kindergarten and steal some food from babies so we could eat properly today, Adrian, all because of Kate and her stinginess." - he couldn't help but laugh at her crazy humor.

"You are \*such\* an \*asshole\*. I still love you. But you're so cartoonishly, unapologetically evil!"

"Why do you always flirt with her and not with me? If you want in, that's not how you do it." - Adrian asked with a smug tone.

Kate turned away while. Vici giggled and gave him a high five. Saying anything would've braced Kate for the same joke next time, and Vici found her discomfort from being brought into this topic absolutely hilarious.

It was taking unusually long, but the group just assumed he stopped for a snack somewhere along the way back from wherever he bolted towards after school was done. At some point, a generic, full-sized red car with tinted windows and way too many company logos on it arrived and beeped twice.

"I guess that's our driver." - Kate assumed and got up to get into the car. "Shotgun's mine."

Victoria quickly blocked her off with a stretched out right arm with an ice maraca in it. "Wait. Whoever is inside might be trying to give us an unsolicited lesson in biology. Cover me, we'll flip the script on them." - she said in a focused tone, smiling.

"Huh?" - Kate asked loudly with utmost confusion.

The front right window opened, revealing Vasil \*as\* the driver. "Beep-beep, muthafucka." - he said proudly.

"Nevermind." - Vici put away her arm along with the ice maraca, exhaled and went inside along with everyone else. "Am I too trigger-happy? No. It can't be." - she wondered in her thoughts.

"They allowed you to drive in the streets already? That's awesome!" - Kate exclaimed as she was getting in.

"I mean, it's not \*that\* impressive, considering cars mostly self-drive now." - Victoria wanted to shrug, but she was still crawling towards the left back seat.

Vasil pressed a button beside the wheel and gave a command for the car to head a few blocks away from somewhere in Kola in a slightly muffled voice. "She's right, but sometimes it's faster to manually take over for a bit and \*then\* surrender the reins after explaining the game plan on the way, rather than giving the system minimal directions in the heat of the moment and hoping it does the right thing. I don't know if I explained it well enough." - he leaned back on his seat, arms behind the neck.

"Uhhh, no." - Adrian admitted. To be fair, he was more focused on sending his target a counterfeit ass pic and instantly deleting it. Not out of quirkiness or anything, it was a great way to control his targets and keep them attached while keeping them lusting for more, according to the teachings of his dark master. At this point, both of them were completely numb to nudes: nipples were like fingernails, vaginas were like eyes, penises were like chins, ears and feet… Well, they were never weird in the first place.

"I can give you a more understandable version later." - Vici promised while inviting a match to a date in a very crowded marketplace with the intention to pretend to be there but being unable to find the date. It was an amazing strategy to prepare the stage for sucking the target bears-dry.

"Also, commands themselves need a bit of training to perfect. It's not crucial for civilians, none of this is, but for emergency services you need to be able to give the system as much as you can in as little words as you can. Also, I straight up love driving. It's a vibe. " - Vasil continued.

"We could tell. Starting to get deja vu from Kate's lecture on every sort of assault rifle used by Omnislavian troopers." - Victoria smiled, drawing random figures on Adrian's left leg with her right index finger while waiting for responses from any of her victims.

"Hey!" - Kate exclaimed.

"I ain't complaining. It's fun learning new information I likely won't ever need in life."

"Who knows about the last part. Life can take you to many wacky places. Look where it took \*me\*." - Vasil pointed out. "Oh, almost forgot." - he opened a stash under his seat, and gave each of the passengers a pistol, starting with Kate. "A polite society is an armed society."

"Aw yea." - Kate observed her gun, like it wasn't the hundredth time she's seen that exact model of a combustion pistol, and put it in her fancy holster.

"What a quote." - Adrian said, putting away his pistol in his backpack. Victoria did the same.

"I wish I could go back in time and live in America. It must have been nice to solve all conflicts in life by squaring off and drawing." - Kate said, making the sounds of drawing, turning off the safety and firing afterwards with her mouth. "Ffft-pew-pew-pew!"

"Told you you have the foundings of a school shooter." - Vici, again, was unable to help herself. She couldn't tell Kate was completely serious.

"If we didn't sit across, I would've slapped you here and now."

"Don't make excuses. I am plenty within your reach. Slap me, you coward." - Victoria dared. Adrian and Vasiliy began watching in excitement.

Kate started preparing her right arm to slap Vici's right leg, which she conveniently put within reach. Suddenly, Kate canceled the windup and launched the slap with full force like a strike of a sword. Unfortunately for her, Victoria turned an ice maraca into a curved sheet of ice wrapped around her leg prior to the slap connecting, and Kate didn't pay enough attention to notice, making her very shocked when the slap hurt a lot more than it should've AND when it made her hand feel frosty. "Aw! Aw! Ohmygod. Holy shit…" - she yanked her hand backwards, turned it into a fist, opened it again, tried to lick it to heat it back up, then put it inside the covered part of her neck when licking didn't work as everyone laughed, Victoria hardest of all. She even dropped her phone.

"Is she okay? Holy hell." - Adrian asked, also laughing. She nodded in response.

"I've been… Worse..." - Kate was hyperventilating. "Man…"

"I wouldn't do it if it wasn't completely safe." - Victoria could barely speak. "She couldn't see it coming, bro… So good…" - she managed to say as Kate pulled out her right hand again and started blowing on it. After a few seconds, Vici continued, "That actually hurt a lot more than it should've. Am I this squishy or do you hit like a train?"

"She hits like a train." - both Adrian and Vasil answered both at the same time and the exact same tone before looking at eachother awkwardly.

A few minutes later they drove past a metallic sign with "Kola" written on it. The landscape hasn't really changed much right away, but the buildings started getting shorter and slightly more sparce.

"Coming up. Make sure you're ready." - Vasil notified Adrian and Vici. Adrian gave him a thumbs up.

A short while later, Victoria asked, "You guys have any gloves? Neither of us use them, and Adrian's metal hand will blow our cover."

"I've got some. I guess I can somehow keep my hand in my coat and hope my hand doesn't freeze." - Kate said with a tone of dread. Vasil sighed and handed Adrian his pair to put on, which he did after putting away his phone. "Thank you. I \*really\* didn't wanna sacrifice mine." - she admitted with relief.

"I can handle a little cold breeze. It's no problem." - Vasil said.

"What about \*her\*? Vici doesn't exactly look like your average middle-schooler to me, with her millions of pockets full of ice."

"You're right! I'll ask JF for what to do." - Vasil reached for a button beside the wheel somewhere.

"Fuck JF, we got this." - Victoria interrupted him. The car stopped and made a beep, indicating arrival. "JF anticipated this problem, but he still approved of the plan while expecting us to do our tasks simultaneously, and you probably won't be able to do yours if we ask for your coat, meaning it doesn't matter if I look weird. I'll take off the crown, that should be enough to get us through if we let our words speak louder than our appearances. Forward then left, right?" - she asked for directions towards the destination in a quick, focused voice.

"Ye."

"Then we're off. The evidence is as good as ours. I hope you change your mind and steal something for us." - Vici and Adrian left the car, leaving the crown behind in the back seats.

"Not happening, sis. But good luck!" - Kate wished them before Victoria closed the door and waved the car as it drove off. The duo went forward.

The suburban streets around them were noticeably quieter than in the big city, even quieter than Mramorsk. "This is about what I'd also pick as a place to sell lung cancer. Either way, you remember the principles of pretending to be a child. Recite to me our backstory." - Vici requested, still in a focused state.

"We're going home from school and we just wanted to grab Jason's cigarettes before going home and recording stupid dances which add nothing positive to society with unbearable music playing in the background."

"Less brutal honesty, but good enough. Extra points for saying 'going home' twice."

"I've decided to keep the funny ball hat for the job. It's the one where it actually would help, I feel like." - Adrian played around with the pom-pom on his hat for around 10 seconds.

"You're not wrong. Let's do this."

They approached a weird, lonely store by the side of a road. There were no markings or signs anywhere, although it looked like the big sign displaying the name was erased, with only the unintelligible silhouette of a name remaining. The logo was written in lowercase and that's as far as Vici wanted to analyze it. The pair put on smiley, joyful faces and entered the door with an "open" cardboard sign.

They were greeted with the interior of an average-sized bakery. While everything looked normal-ish for one, the place was a bit run-down, some walls and windows being cracked, even though it was clear the staff did its best to cover it up. There was churchey music playing on the speakers, and coughs coming from somewhere. There were weird empty spaces in several places with dismembered \*should i keep this as funny brazilglish?\* white tubes beside them, suggesting the building was stripped of their heating systems at some point earlier. Adrian could even feel how shitty was the insulation in the building. "Yep, definitely Healing Paw." - he thought.

"Welcome to the Blessing of St. Zosimas? Are you… cold, my child?" - an amicable man at the counter in his thirties asked Victoria somberly with concern. Confusion on his face was also somewhat obvious. He was dressed in a grey sweater with black and white lines. Behind him was what Adrian assumed to be the staff room door, and he could sense a third adult behind it with his psychic powers sitting somewhere.

"Oh, hehe, sowwy. My coat was stowen by my cwassmate Mike. He's a meanie." - she spoke in a slightly higher pitched tone than usual.

"Why is there a tewwowist cweaning the cownews?" - Adrian asked in a stupid, childish voice after taking off his hat and putting it inside his coat, pointing at a figure in a desaturated yellow burka cleaning a surprisingly clean corner for whatever reason. He knew none of that was exactly polite, but he figured a normal child his age from the middle of nowhere would be a bit more prejudiced than normal.

The "terrorist" looked at him, made a couple of sickly coughs of an elderly woman, took a dry, whistling deep breath, then put down their rag, stood up and bowed, all very slowly. "This is Elicia, my child. She isn't a terrorist, but a loyal servant of Christ. It's a part of the teachings of Pope Michael the First for women to obscure their entire bodies from anyone except their family. It is necessary to protect them from… harm. Are you familiar with his teachings? Tell me, children, what are your names?" - the guy at the counter asked, still talking somberly. Vici was pretty sure she heard priests in media speaking less priest-like than him. She was also struck by the pain of being unable to call the guy at the counter stupid without breaking cover.

"I am Dima! Dima the Fourth!" - Adrian exclaimed with a smile and made finger guns with both of his hands. He actually had no idea what "the Fourth" stood for, given it was clearly different from kings' names.

"And I am… Blueball!" - Victoria exclaimed, raising her right fist into the air. Adrian started fake laughing to play along, and Vici joined in. He wasn't sure what exactly happened, but the fake laughter turned real for both of them and kept growing in potency until they both could barely stand, all the while the bakery staff stared at them, with the man's face showing more confusion than Victoria ever thought was possible for a face in real life to show. Elicia also didn't move at all, also probably mortified by two autistic gremlins invading their lair. "I am sowwy… My bwother has stupid." - Blueball eventually took hold of herself and her worry that they were overacting, showing them a palm of "I am fine".

Dima the Fourth took a deep breath and suppressed his laughter. "We're hewe to pick up…" - but laughter took hold of him once more. Elicia started coughing very badly, but everyone ignored her.

"We'we hewe to pick up Jason's cat fuw. Awso, that croysand. It wooks tasty." - Blueball managed to win the a struggle against her body, fully regaining her composure and mask. And no, she didn't plan to actually eat a croissant from this creepy place.

The cashier stared at her with extreme confusion some more, and eventually asked:

"How much cat fur cigarettes are you looking to purchase, my child?" - it was obvious he wanted to ask a lot more questions than that. "Yes… Wait, Jason said you knew the numbew he asked fow. Do you not remembew the numbew?" - Blueball danced around the place awkwardly. By this point, Dima also recovered his composure. The woman in the burka slowly went back to cleaning an already perfectly clean corner.

"Ah, I… see. Perhaps the enlightenment already took hold of the poor child. I would recommend buying 25 packs for his vacation, but unfortunately we only have 17 left in stock. Thankfully, we have plenty of dog fur ones in stock to fill up the rest. We will grant you two this blessed caramel bread for free." - the man pointed at half of a small loaf of bread. It looked like a weird mix of black and white bread both Blueball nor Dima have never seen, but otherwise it was perfectly fine.

"Ooo, fwee food, I like fwee food. One second." - she approached Dima and pretended to check his pockets. "Hmmm… Dumbface, whewe is youw phone?"

"I don't know. I thought I gave it to you." - Dima shrugged.

"Check youw backpack. Maybe it's thewe."

They took off their backpacks, put them down and bent over to pretend to look around them. Dima received a nod from Blueball and they both quickly picked up their pistols, turned off the safeties and aimed them at the bakery staff. "This is a robbery! Hands in the air! Hands in the fucking air, both of you! Any sudden movements and we'll kill both of you!" - he aimed his pistol at the guy near the cash register while Blueball aimed it also at the same guy at first, but then switched to aiming at Elicia instead, even though she posed little danger. The man took several seconds to raise his hands in the air, still with a face of extreme confusion, while Elicia took like 20 seconds to stand up and do the same while mumbling something about a Kemirda Pata. The third adult in the staff room stood up shortly and began walking around.

"Why would you rob a holy establishment like this, my children?" - the cashier asked with a betrayed and confused tone.

"Churches never helped us…" - but then he realized there was a better thing to say. "Ah, who am I kidding. You're easy marks! You're located in the middle of nowhere, and you'll probably never even tell the cops that we robbed you, as the nearest police officer is a kiloalligator away. That door behind you, is there anyone in there?" - Dima asked loudly and aggressively while not letting the man free from his aim even for a second. He was allowed to take charge of this operation even though Vici didn't deem him skilled enough, mainly because he really really wanted to and because he would've been sad if he wasn't allowed to.

Dima didn't receive an answer, and even though he already knew it, he asked again with half-fake anger, "Are you deaf? Do you wanna see heaven so bad? If not, answer my questions, and answer them \*right\*! Is. There. Anyone. Behind. That. Door?" - nothing happened. Adrian shot and destroyed a window to the left of the man and aimed at him again, and he finally shook his head several times in quick succession. "Oh, you think you're smart, don't ya? Listen here, you manager dickhead! Come out with your hands up or I'll fucking murder everyone in here!" - Dima shouted. It was a little obvious that he was enjoying his roleplay way too much. Well, not to any of the staff members. But the door didn't open, even though he could feel the presumed manager had just approached it and began standing right behind it. "On the count of 10, I am killing both of them. 1, 2, 3, 4…" - Elicia's coughing interrupted the countdown. "...5, 6, 7…"

A bald middle-aged man with a long beard, black winter pants and a yellow winter coat finally revealed himself by kicking open the door and aiming a long-barreled shotgun at Adrian, nothing like the short ones from games. He had the most hideous face, and in some places Adrian couldn't tell if chunks of it were covered in pimples or exposed mutated flesh. Before Dima could even have a proper look, he instinctively shot the target right in the head before either of them could process noticing eachother, then once more just in case he survived before aiming the gun back at the cashier. "Now look what you've done, you idiot. Your colleague is dead because of you." - Blueball commented as the woman in a burka collapsed from shock, not letting her out of sights in case she was performing too. That semi-nonsensical comment was perfect for the performance.

The only remaining staff member opened his mouth from shock too. "Go stand near Elicia with your hands up and I won't shoot out your Willy Wonka." - Dima ordered him. He delayed for a few seconds and complied. "What's the safe combination?" - he asked as the remaining conscious hostage was moving as ordered.

The hostage took a deep, strained breath. "We have no safe." - he spoke very quickly and anxiously in a completely different tone from earlier. "All the money is in the bottom drawer and the cash register."

"Yuli, clean everything out." - Victoria smiled at the nickname choice, picked up Adrian's backpack and did as ordered, starting with the cash register. "Unload and grab that shotgun, too. Hopefully it's not blood-stained enough to be rendered unusable. Or unsellable."

"Was gonna take it anyway." - she admitted. After cleaning up the cash register, noticing a phone with a soundboard on screen in a video call with a run-down ceiling beside the cash register, turning it off and stealing it, unloading and stashing the shotgun, and then disappearing in the staff room for so long that Adrian had to call out and ask her if she was still alive at some point, she came back in one piece. After looting the pockets of every single staff member while taking every precaution necessary, they were finally done.

"Have a good life now, you hear?" - Dima told the cashier before waltzing away from the building. The man just kept sitting down against a wall, like he'd been shot, and didn't respond.

After getting plenty far away from the building and notifying Kate with a message about their success, Vici said:

"That couldn't have gone smoother. Even us losing it during that one moment probably only helped our mask. You've outperformed all of my expectations, seems like I shouldn't have been worried. It's like you're learning to think and operate like me. Well, you literally are. That was the plan. Either way, never been prouder." - she gave Adrian an affectionate head scratch through the hat.

"Thank you… Is my fake-hothead mask good? It comes more naturally than yours." - he felt like he never felt better in his life.

"It looks like it's working and that's all that matters. See anywhere we can hide out and wait for a taxi to pick us up? Worried about being in the open in case they send someone after us." - Victoria was vigilantly scanning nearby surroundings.

"What about any of these alleyways?" - Adrian pointed at one of them.

"I guess that's as good as we're getting. Wanna know what kinda haul we've got?" - they both went towards it.

"Uh huh."

"Well, I've managed to fit most of the food they sold. I've cleaned the shotgun so it doesn't contaminate anything. I stripped the old ass computer for parts in general and not just the hard drive to make us look like loot goblins. Which we absolutely are, now that I think of it." - she smiled and nodded. Adrian also chuckled. "The motherboard, the mouse, the headphones, the cooler, RAM sticks, if that's what they're called… pretty much everything which wasn't bulky enough to fit inside. That's why I needed this much time, I had to look up how to handle any of it and not get electrocuted."

"What about money?"

"Wait, I wasn't done. Found a cute little music box and some small paintings of who were probably meant to be angels. There was a big one, but it wouldn't fit." - she found a quiet enough place to sit beside a trashcan, additionally covering up herself and Adrian with a big trashbag nearby. "Call us a cab, we're probably safe."

"Yes, ma'am." - Adrian opened his phone and began ordering a taxi to the duo's whereabouts. The plan was to call it towards their home and not the police station, then let Kate or Vasil bring the evidence to the police for even further misdirection, which, spoiler, wasn't needed.

"Got 4 whole phones, two of which we don't even need to give to the cops. I'm gonna see if we can keep one of them and maybe gift the other to Kate, it looks like something right up her alley with how unnecessarily luxurious it is. And finally, we've got like 4K bears in total. Shame I can't unlock the phones without a hard reset, I would've loved to steal all of their retirement money."

"Yea, it's still great, given the circumstances. Matt might know how to bypass the security, though." - Victoria's neurons activated from the realization, and she took an excited breath. "We still might be getting that old lady's life savings and maybe even a treasure map to an island full of gold." - Adrian rubbed his hands against one another.

"You're so right! This could be very, very big." - she was also very excited.

The cab arrived shortly after, except it arrived too far away from where it was ordered for no reason whatsoever. After eventually sorting out that fiasco and finally getting in, Vici called Kate after requesting the driver to keep his mouth shut about the following conversation.

"Howdy! Took you guys a while, I don't remember it taking this long when \*we\* did it." - Kate greeted them.

"We, as in me and Adrian, needed a bit more finesse this time. Sup." - Victoria greeted her back.

"We still nailed it. Like you said, old habits die hard. How'd your side of the job go?" - Adrian asked.

"We found precisely fffffff-uck all. Most likely rented his Cheburnet ID with the scums you robbed for money, which carries crippling fines but is completely irrelevant to our investigation. Found some- Vasya, for fuck's sake!" - she said the last part extra loudly, and it was followed by Vasil's sinister laughter in the background. Kate coughed twice performatively. "Found some extra evidence incriminating him for petty crimes, but we just put it all back where we found it and wrote him a note to hide it better, dude's overwhelmed with trouble as is." - she sounded as energetic as usual.

"Well, JF will probably find out \*now\*. They have every reason to monitor our calls." - Vici observed.

"Fuuuuuuuuck, man..." - she said very sadly.

Everything proceeded according to plan afterwards. They agreed to meet up with Matt to ask him for help with a "problem" without clarifying more, got home, gave all the evidence to Kate and Vasil to analyze in the police station, and took a 20 minute walk to

Matt's place to try to get the phones unlocked.

After riding an elevator all the way to the 8th floor, they approached the door to his apartment.

"Scared to think what kind of a cave he lives in." - Adrian commented, smiling.

"It probably has a lot of…" - Victoria pulled out an ice maraca and did a trick of making it quickly expand into a tree, except instead of branches it had arms and hands, all facing upward, and she made it grow right near Adrian's face. "...this."

He stepped back a bit. "Agh! Man, you're such a bully." - they both laughed.

The apartment door was slightly open, so they walked into a terrace \*is this the right word\* like any other, and there was nobody inside.

"You know, it's pretty dangerous to leave the door open like that. A burglar might march in and take anything they want." - Adrian said loudly after closing the door.

"They'd need to get past my insane ninja skills first. Coming!" - Matt shouted from another room and made his appearance shortly after as Adrian was changing up. "Want some tea? My parents drink this unreasonably expensive mix. I've never tried but you'll probably love it." - he was smiling, but also looked focused, and had a pen in his left hand.

"There's always a catch with these luxury goods, but yea, I'm game." - Adrian said, still busy changing his shoes, all the while Vici was building a large hollow 3D projection of an orthotope (a 4D rectangle) made of shapeshifted ice without any faces. Matt was completely lost in its beauty for a decent while, and Victoria rotated a little to give him a better view. It was completely standard for her to screw around like that when she didn't feel like milking victims for money on dating apps: her work/life balance has been getting a lot less self-destructive ever since the incident a month ago. It still sucked.

When they eventually took their seats on the fluffy white couch in the kitchen, Vici asked:

"So how come you assume this tea is so great considering you've never tried it?"

"Well, you probably won't give me shit for it. I am a cyborg." - Matt replied, his tone sounding like he was ready to die here and now.

"No shit!" - Adrian made a large shrug.

"What do you got? Brain implants, digestive system bionics, or?" - Vici asked, leaning back.

"The second, I think. Basically, I had some sort of a nasty genetic disease when I wasn't even 2 years old, and my entire digestive system needed to be replaced with a bionic which makes me powered by liquid fuel aswell as vitamins and minerals diluted in water."

"No. Way." - Adrian's neurons activated.

"Does this system have a scientific name? I'm curious now." - Victoria pulled up her phone and prepared to type.

"Toplophagic digestion. It's expensive, but it seems to be keeping me alive." - Matt pulled out a small green electronic part and began staring at it, rotating it once in a while.

"What do any of those words mean… Is this a complicated way to say you have a combustion engine inside you?" - Vici was trying to read the wiki along with Adrian.

"No, no dieselpunk involved here. To simplify, it's a similar concept to combustion engines, but with much less waste." - Matt explained. He noticed that the tea was ready, and poured the guests a cup each before sitting down with them on a chair.

"Man, it's weird how many cyborgs we have in our class. Even back at the lab, we had 4 Starbloods in one block at some point." - Adrian commented.

"Yea…" - Victoria smiled, still looking at the wiki page. "Wait a minute, that's not what we came here for." - she turned off her phone and put it in her pocket.

"Right. Right."

"We need help unlocking 2 phones for an investigation, ASAP. We can't use the backdoors, since that leaves behind traces which we can't have. Can you help us?" - she tried to take a sip of tea, but even the cup was too hot to handle, which she \*really\* could've anticipated. "It's burning hot, hun. Let me cool it down before we drink this." Adrian put his cup back down after picking it up with his bionic with no trouble, allowing Vici to use her ice magic to cool down the tea.

Matt put a fist near his mouth. "Well, I theoretically can. The thing is, with the modern security measures it's impossible to brute force them with a primitive robot, or to install a virus which removes them, so the only option left is physically extracting the drive, which modern technology like this isn't designed for anymore, figuring out which values stand for the unlock data with extremely specialized tools, replacing the values with defaults found on an identical drive of the same type for the same device, and then putting it all back together." - he explained, making it look like his right hand was the one moving its mouth. Vici and Adrian did their best not to laugh, even if it wasn't nearly the first time he did this. "I'd need to take time to learn how to do all of this, an identical drive, the equipment required and to actually go through the entire hassle. Can you guys ask for your bosses to give me a slice of the cake? I'm gonna need to cancel a lot of stuff to do this ASAP, and even then it might take a couple days."

"We'll cover all your expenses and give you 2K bears on top after you're done." - Vici sipped her tea.

"2K? Sweet! Then consider it done." - Matt gave her a cheerful thumbs up.

"This is some good shit." - Adrian commented outloud after also sipping his tea, still trying to deduce the reason why Matt was okay with lowballs this bad.

"Yea, it probably is, it's just so expensive for no reason. I could make a giant bag of this exact same mix and it'd cost 5 times less per weight, plus leave some extra ingredients for cooking, but my parents don't trust me with that for some reason. Their loss, honestly." - Matt shrugged.

The duo went back home and left Matt alone with their phones and went home to take the rest of the day off. Adrian was really hoping to stay and hang out, but Matt claimed his parents were approaching home, and if they found out about his friends, they would have bombarded him with an uncomfortable amount of invasive questions, and it was one of the rare things Matt seemed to hate in life.

After a few days of the usual mix of school, games, police work, pistol practice, pawning the rest of the spoils for chump change and Victoria pointing the flashlight in full force with red color at random apartment windows to keep her average amount of triggered panic attacks to at least 3 a day, Matt has finally granted her and Adrian the unlocked phones at around 19 hours as they were all sitting on a bench in a playground near the Starbloods' apartment block. Both Adrian and Vici took one of the phones each and checked if they were unlocked. Adrian got the fancy one, Vici got the one which didn't imply crippling insecurity for its former owner. They were unlocked with no problems, and the duo could even access the messengers and see plenty of unread messages from family and friends.

"Wow! You actually did it! That's so-" - Adrian was exclaiming before getting his cheek pinched by Victoria.

"Yep, it looks like it's all working. We can still hard reset the phones after we're done and pawn or claim them if the cops allow us to, right?" - she asked, composed.

"No-no-no. Like I said, you need to disconnect the devices from the manufacturer company account before then, which is nothing you need my help with. But after that, yea, it's safe, I double-checked for both of them." - Matt explained.

"Good. You've done us a great favor. And your country, I guess, but that's whatever." - Vici pulled out her own phone and opened the bank app, transferred Matt 2 thousand bears and showed him the successful transaction screen. "Keep the change from the previous transfers." - she said with a calm smile, as Adrian was aggressively rummaging through the messages of the old lady from earlier on the fancy phone, looking for something interesting.

"Really? Thanks! You know, even if I had to take a lot of sacrifices to make this happen this quick, it was really fun. Good luck with the investigation!" - he stood up, gave the duo a little wave and walked away.

"Bye!" - Adrian and Vici said back to back, kept waving at him for 10 seconds, and went back to their phones.

"Check the bank. Check the bank." - Vici said extremely quickly, and the duo began aggressively searching the home page for the bank apps. The one on Vici's phone was called Omnislavian National People's Bank of (or ONPB for short; Vici was familiar with the bank before and she found it using 2.5 nationalist naming prefixes as a hilarious overkill). She entered the app and got blocked by having to type in the pin code or use facial recognition to confirm identity to enter. "No, no… We were so close. Fuck." - she cursed in frustration.

"What's up? Pin code? Shit, got the same thing." - Adrian said before tabbing out of the app on his bank before it could capture his face with the automatically-activated frontal camera (for facial recognition) and pressed the screen against his leg. "I guess this is what he was talking about, with some apps having extra protection he can't crack. Don't tell me that's as far as we can get." - he said with disappointment.

"It is. There's no way we could still stay under the radar if we somehow seek out these guys, and even then, how would we find their locations? JF isn't \*that\* stupid to be tricked into helping us here." - Victoria sighed. "Fuck. Let's check their social media, we might find something interesting."

"I already found something. Check this out." - Adrian leant back and switched tabs to the messenger and began scrolling upwards to the start of a conversation as Vici also leant back to watch. It started on 11th of January, 2091, and it was between Elicia and some man named Andreas.

The conversation went as follows:

"mom, we need to talk.

you need to stop with this stupid cult, i know we have no other alternatives besides not doing anything, but look at how far you've changed since you started. these ""meds"" are making your health so much worse. when something brings more negative side effects than benefit, its a clear sign that you should stop, not double down. you used to be a psychiatrist, for christs sake.

kelly misses you and asks me every other day if we can see you sometime, but i cant in good sanity show her the you that youve become. i keep telling her that youre ok and that youre making progress, but the bubble will eventually pop and ill need to not drown in the sea of tears that comes out of her when that happens.

please, reconsider." - Andreas wrote.

Elicia always answered in messages in a hispanic, half pissed-off, half passive-aggressive, yet somehow super slow voice. Somehow it sounded even more elderly than normal. Naturally, Adrian put it on 2x playback speed to keep Victoria's attention from wandering off, and it was still barely enough. "Andreas, you're bothering me with your annoying constant attempts to dissuade me. They are very reputable professionals and they offer me the cheapest and most reliable help that exists anywhere in the world. One day you'll grow up and understand where I'm coming from, but for now, trust your mamma, hijo, trust your mamma. They are good people, and they only want what's best for me." - Elicia said.

"mom, i am 36 years old and i have 2 kids! why are you still playing that card? even misha knows your out of your mind and he doesn't even know you volunteer for them which is even worse and he just hit eighth grade. you are slowly and painfully killing yourself. think for a second. fun time is over. you already have liver cancer and hephaestus c or whatever, you dont need lung cancer too. if you die, it will be me who will need to arrange your funeral and calm down my family after what happened, and i have enough problems in my life already. stop, please. im scared. i dont want to lose you. you are making it harder and harder to sleep at night."

"Watch it, Andreas." - Elicia coughed in the voice message. "You can't speak to your mother like that. God doesn't like disobedient children, and no matter how big you and your family are, you will always be my son." - there was more in that voice message and the conversation in general, but it was more of the same depressing and frustrating shit.

Adrian stared into the ground somewhere emptily. "I can't believe this. This is what they're putting people and their families through for chump change."

"Oh, relax. It's just the usual consequences of tigers mauling off the victims' legs to prevent them from being able to run away. This old lady was old and desperate, she bit the hook and got reeled in. She couldn't follow the law of the jungle and became some clergymen's dinner." - Victoria explained, completely unbothered by anything she read, heard or said.

"I guess."

"Still trying to convince Adrian that might makes right is the main mechanism behind the way the world works?" - Kate's voice was heard from behind the bench.

Vici got startled, turned around to watch as Kate went in front of the bench, and shut off her stolen phone. "Oh, hi. How'd you notice us here?"

"I don't know, I was just heading towards a specific bench I was told to go to on the playground near our home and you happened to be sitting right here. Some coincidence, right?" - Kate said with post-ironic passive-aggression and shrugged, still standing to the forward right of the duo without sitting down.

"Alright, bro. You just \*love\* rubbing it in, don't you? Shitface." - Vici replied playfully.

Kate laughed. "Hey, Adrian."

"Yo." - he replied in a flat tone.

"You may aswell sit down." - Victoria signaled Kate to sit to the right of her in an empty space, which the latter did. "And again, I am not saying 'might makes right' summarizes all that ever happens in the world, but on a macro scale, for every Starshard of Murmansk, that is exactly what's going on. You're also a part of it too: you just use your agency to pick your prey while still tearing them in pieces with sharp, erect puma claws." - Vici shrugged. She said the last part mostly metaphorically, although Kate did sometimes get ordered to execute someone, which she always did with no remorse, thanks to the adults choosing the right kinda people and the right kinda framing for her. "That's probably not the right word." - she said quieter and faster while Kate was replying.

"Sure I am, but that principle implies leaving 'the weak' to die, which I don't do. Which not even you universally do. You could theoretically just blackmail me into doing your bidding with violence or abuse, but you're not doing that and we're still hanging despite the past. Not even \*you\* follow this law of the jungle, you edgelord." - Kate argued, not even sure at this rate whether to take Victoria seriously or not. The inappropriate usage of the word "erect" had gone completely unnoticed by her.

"Nuh uh, that's not how that works. Protecting those who matter is a vital part of the law, since power gives you the agency to do whatever the fuck you want, including protecting others." - Vici embraced Adrian with her left hand, as he continued staring into somewhere and thinking, and put her right one on Kate's shoulder at the same time, as the rest was too far to reach.

Kate took it as an invitation and promptly entered the group hug, leaning her head against Victoria's shoulder. After a few seconds of thinking, Kate finally replied, "...Wow. I can't believe- I don't know what to think anymore."

"Like I said, you're making conscious choices to prey on the ones who deserve it rather than anyone marked with a red dot on the minimap, and that's what makes you different, not that you're living within an entirely different ecosystem. If that's how you wanna have fun with life, who are we to stop you?" - Kate learnt by now that saying "fun has nothing to do with it" would fall on deaf ears, so she just didn't say anything. "Speaking of stopping, wanna see what we dug up?"

"It's wild. You gotta see this." - Adrian turned off the sleep mode on his stolen Svechka phone and handed it over to Kate after scrolling back to the start of the conversation from earlier.

Kate took the phone. "Oh… I shouldn't." - she tried to give Adrian the phone back, still admiring the craftsmanship as she held it out.

"I know what you're thinking. Blah, blah, violation of privacy, but trust me, you do \*not\* wanna miss this. If you still refuse, we'll just read it to you outloud." - Vici promised.

"Okay, okay, what is it…" - she began reading and listening. "Oh no…" - she said grievously after the first message. "Ugh, adults and their \*arrogance\*." - she commented with disgust after the first voice message.

"Yea, I prefer childish arrogance myself." - Vici replied.

After reading and listening a couple messages further, she stopped and handed Adrian the phone again, and this time he took it. "The adult fucks! They found a terminally-ill grandma with a large family and made her even more terminally-ill? How fucking evil even are Christians?" - she began angrily asking.

"That's what I'm asking." - Adrian agreed.

"As evil as everyone else. Never really dived deep into the subject, but apparently this whole scam started with snake oil and hypocritical dogma and was later abused constantly to extort material power through nonexistent divine leverage. Oh, and stomp women into the ground for a nice bonus, since the key to heaven was literally just a penis." - Victoria explained, not that she had a full picture. Kate was starting to get desensitized to Vici being gross from time to time. Thankfully, her line of work and her own complete desensitization only forced Kate to deal with occasional dirty mentions and comparisons like these and not actual… images. "Roman and medieval scammers worked a bit differently, but in the end their fishnets did their job. Don't think I actually asked, do \*you\* believe in anyone?" - she asked Adrian.

He thought for a bit. "Sort of, but not really. It's complicated. It was, anyway, but now that I think of it, doubt I'll be visiting church any time soon." - he replied calmly.

"I just can't believe this… How could a cult this evil become so mainstream? It's the world's most popular religion. How did we let that happen as a society?" - Kate asked, agitated.

"Never underestimate the power of human stupidity, Kate, and most of the world's mysteries would be solved for you." - Victoria noted. She actually had tons of fun discussing what she perceived as the history of scamming, even if the tone of her voice didn't show it.

"Did \*you\* ever believe, Vici?" - Adrian asked.

"Ha ha." - she replied with audible sass.

"I mean, I could have guessed the answer, but what's your story, if you have one? I reckon you do."

"Story? It's simple. If God is so benevolent and all-powerful, then no, he's fucking not. I am the living antithesis to that statement, as both a carrier and spreader of inhuman volumes of suffering. Case closed." - she grinned meta-ironically as Kate turned her head away.

"That's concise and straightforward."

"Yes… You know one thing which I \*do\* find extremely weird?" - she shifted her tone to a thoughtful one.

"Mmm?"

"If I wanted to make a medical scam, I'd sell the cheapest placebo I could buy as legitimate, overpowered medicine. Minimum investment, maximum profit, no traces of bad judgement calls in the victims' organisms. Kate, why are you gloomy again? Everything alright?" - she interrupted herself and looked at Kate.

"It's nothing. I'm alright. Anyway, makes sense." - Kate turned her head back towards her friends.

"You know what doesn't? The fact that Healing Paw sells cigarettes which require semi-advanced manufacturing and different compounds which require time and/or effort. And that they aren't harmless, but actively detrimental to your health."

"Huh." - Kate huh'd.

"Maybe it's luxury merchandise? The price markups on the cigs was pretty big." - Adrian brought up.

"They weren't that high. Maybe you're right and I have no idea what luxury means. Speaking of luxury, wanna take this Svechka phone off our hands, Kate? We figured it's something up your alley."

"It is, actually! It's so much better than mine, but also it was mugged off an old, terminally-ill lady. Not… something I am okay with." - Kate admitted.

"Oh, come on. JF said we could take anything and everything from them. It's legally ours, and after a hard reset, there will be no grandma's traces left." - Victoria bluffed. Well, more half-bluffed, since JF omitted any instructions in that regard, so it was perfectly plausible that they were given free reign in that regard as long as they got the job done.

Kate laughed. "You made that sound worse."

"Oops."

After recovering, Kate finally continued, "Either way, even if JF approved of it, it ain't right. And even if it didn't feel so goddamn weird, the association will never leave me alone, even if you snap the old lady out of existence." - she relapsed back into dying of laughter.

"Your loss, our gain." - Vici made a small shrug, smiling. It was still surreal to see all 3 of them hanging out together again.

They hung out for a while longer, eventually moving on to Kate and Vici's parents' bed to watch surreal Fruitnaz fan animation where characters were granted hilarious extra traits and ways of speech the original never had. At some point, Vici got a notification on her phone from her mother. There wasn't anyone else at home.

As she was pulling out her phone, Adrian got a notification too, and it was displayed right over the flatscreen. He paused the video playback on his phone and also opened the message, along with Kate.

"Is she for real? Past midnight? Into fucking Oroborovsk?" - Victoria remarked with apathy as she was replying something back to her step-mom. "Wait, you guys got the same message too?"

"Uh huh." - Kate affirmed in a laid-back tone. All 3 of them got a similar message from the same person. "Sounds like fun, plus Vasiliy is coming. You're not very happy about this, are you?"

"Yea, I'm gonna ask them to sweeten the deal on this one. Breaking my back by working past midnight for a big but not life-changing amount of money ain't worth it." - Adrian commented. Kate knew he wasn't at fault for feeling this way: it seemed like his smaller pool of energy wasn't something he could control.

"Good. They sure as shit better have some better motivation in store." - Victoria agreed.

After some time waiting for the reply, she received a reply and showed it to her friends with a smile. "Aw yea, this just gets better and better." - Kate said happily.

"Well, that's a big enough chip on the table to change my mind." - Adrian began disconnecting his phone from the screen in front of his friends and getting up to prepare for the journey as Victoria was affirming their participation.

The message which caused such a drastic 180-turn was "You'll get to skip school tomorrow ;) and everything else if you want".

The trio assumed new, more plain, clothes of cold colors, making every single one of them look like a pre-teen boy from a paid school, and forced to wear new moderately-thick winter clothes and hats, even Victoria, to her discontent. Adrian was allowed to keep wearing the funny pom-pom hat. Nobody took their pistols, since apparently they'd be given special ones for the job, and Vici could fit considerably less ice in her pockets.

Some Starblood's step-dad picked them up into his car and began driving them to the airport. The car was a spacious red jeep and it had much less company strapped on it than usual, only around 8 in total. Kate got the shotgun, as always.

"I look completely ridiculous, man. Our indoor getup is even worse. It's actually just negative drip." - Vici looked downwards on her clothes, smiling grievously. And the worst part is, she didn't even wear the gloves she was given.

"I heard from some 7th graders that other paid schools sometimes force students into dress codes like this one. Sounds awful." - Kate commented.

"Ugh. Literally 2084."

"Sorry, but you know-" - the middle-aged driver with a thick mustache said before getting spoken over.

"Yea, yea, important for the mission. I've been forcing myself to do shit I didn't like for years. I can handle being dressed like a normal person for a bit." - Victoria said with mild irritation and boredom. "If this counts as normal."

"At least they put the 'boy' in 'cowboy' for Kate's case." - Adrian said, admiring the beauty of late evening Murmansk. He wasn't bothered much by a change in dress code: he was used to looking like a generic goon, and looking like a generic 11 year old master of calculus, or whatever did the kids that age do in their expensive, soulless schools, wasn't that much worse.

"Oh, shut up." - Kate chuckled. "Just because I always wear boyish clothes doesn't mean I like looking like a loser with better physics grades than personality.

They eventually got to the airport, met up with a bunch of G-men in sunglasses and minimalistic black coats, and embarked on a long walk through the airport halls. Vici could've sworn the airport was notoriously dirty last time she checked, but now it was almost perfectly clean for some reason.

The Starshard group has eventually arrived near a gold-painted private jet. Unlike commercial or cargo planes, this one was only a few alligators long, but it wasn't as compact as most fighter jets either.

"That's the chariot that'll take you to Oroborovsk. One of our friends from the FBS shall explain you the details. Good luck on the mission, and make your country proud!" - the car's driver from earlier said, performing the standard Omnislavian salute of putting his right fist against the temple. FBS, or Federal Bureau of Security, was "pretty much more serious countrywide police", as it was described, and it was still unofficially insubordinate to Fist of Liberty. \*used to be mind of liberty aka MOL here, idk why, doublecheck if it makes sense\*

Kate and Vasiliy saluted him back and went inside, while Vici and Adrian didn't salute back. "Yea, we got it." - she said and went inside along with everyone else along with some bald G-man. She and Adrian never saluted the adults except when it was required to make it subtly clear that she's fueled by money, not nationalism. It was unclear if that changed anything at all on the adults' end.

Everyone took off their coats, revealing Vasiliy also dressed equally as lame as everyone else, while the FBS agent just wore a business suit under the coat. There was a semi-small table with 4 seats around it, all 4 occupied by the Starshards, plus another smaller table with 2 seats surrounding it, one of which the FBS agent sat on. Kate and Adrian got seats near the windows. Everyone put their phones in flight mode, and the plane took off shortly after.

After a while of admiring the view, the adult in the plane asked:

"Alright. Let me brief you on your mission. How much do you know already?" - his tone was a lot colder and more brutish than the children were used to when dealing with adults, even in the lab.

"Something about a sting operation revealing the cigs in Murmansk being supplied by a certain textile factory in Oroborovsk, which we need to infiltrate. And also that the guy in charge of the textile company we're infiltrating being the Healing Paw's biggest donor by a mile, so if the location isn't a decoy, it means the end for both the organization and the CEO of the textile company." - Victoria explained.

"Correct. While the drive you took from the bakery wasn't sufficient enough to determine the supplier, the retrieved data was analyzed by JF, more fronts were discovered, a tracker was put on one of the supplying trucks and your destination was discovered." - the man explained was looking at the children blankly. That emotionless, soulless tone of speech was something only Vici was capable of.

"Do you FBS boys also rely on JF in your investigations like we do?" - Vasil asked. Kate was still mesmerized by the view outside the window, although she was still paying attention to the briefing just fine.

His question was completely ignored. "After we land, I can take you a couple of bus stops away from your destination, leaving you to cover the rest of the way on foot, or I can drop you off near an apartment block on the way where you can borrow a car from one of the sleeping citizens."

"Yes! Option two! I always wanted to stealy wheely an automobiley!" - Vasil exclaimed in excitement.

"Vasil!" - Kate said, her smile ruining her attempt at making a judgemental tone.

Adrian began laughing, Victoria began wheezing. "I knew you had it in you!" - she said finally. Vasil was also wearing this mask of a protector of order and justice, and seeing him show his true colors was quite satisfying.

After a while of staring at the Starshards with an exasperated face that seemed to scream "I want to go full Master Skywalker on all of you" and waiting for them to finish laughing their asses off and look back at him, he finally continued, "Your task is to break into the factory and acquire proof of toxic cigarettes and/or food being manufactured, then send it to JF, get out and let us do the rest. Adrian's psychic vision should help locate the secret facility if it's inside, underneath or otherwise connected to the factory. Search for signatures of tons of animals in one room. Also, try to minimize the casualties, especially if the guards or workers aren't aware of the cult activity, but don't hesitate to neutralize anyone who stands in your way or puts you in danger. You shall be outfitted with cameras on your necks to record everything you see, the building architecture plan with the security camera locations and silenced pistols. Note that they're still reasonably loud and neutralizing targets or disabling cameras even with it would still put you on a timer before the factory security is alerted."

"Are the guards armored or can we shoot them in the head twice and be done?" - Vici asked thoughtfully. Everyone else just listened without a word.

"Standard security guards are only protected with 9mm pneumatic pistols and a flak vest, but the ones guarding the secret facility might have stolen military-grade equipment or even combat androids if you're unlucky. Exercise caution."

Adrian's and Vasil's eyes widened. "Androids, great. I always wanted to die before puberty, guess now's my chance." - Victoria remarked cynically. The actual wars were dominated by various types of combat androids due to their endurance, super-intelligence, obedience, cost-efficiency… Even the cheap, expendable models were much better than humans in almost every aspect when it came to direct warfare, and according to an educational video, they turned the mechanics of war completely upside down when they first became widespread. Humans, even non-cyborgs, were still used on the battlefield plentifully, though.

"Oh, come on, Gal Capone. We got this. We don't even need to destroy any of them, just record that shit and leave." - Kate tried to reassure her.

"You don't understand. We've watched a video about them, these aren't your stupid bolt buckets or clankers from games, they're 5 times as hypervigilant as I am, they have real-life aimbot, they have infinite morale, and they're resistant even to medium caliber bullets, so 9mm bullets should bounce off like rubber." - Victoria turned to Kate and began explaining with mild frustration. She also wanted to comment on how much she loved the nickname, but it'd make the rest of what she wanted to say feel less serious.

"Yep, can confirm. They fuck, nothing she just said was a hyperbole." - Adrian nodded with an awkward face. "You \*do\* have a plan for us not to instantly die, right? I doubt even a threat like this is enough to intimidate you into submission."

"Well, yea, submission doesn't exactly pay well. We just need a perfect plan with all the failsafes so we can run if we see one, or to somehow blind the fucker with the flashlight if it's just one and not 20 horny misanthropic death robots." - Vici thought aloud, adamant to get the job done.

"I can't believe no matter what we do and what direction life takes us, some things just don't change." - Kate commented, smiling. "I've got a plan, Adrian!" - she said in a proper cowboy accent.

"You've always got a plan!" - Adrian responded, also in a cowboy accent. It has improved vastly since last time.

Kate and Adrian looked at Vasil in suspense. "This is a good one." - joy was written all over Kate's face when he finally said it with an appropriate accent.

"If mocking my unsophisticated choice of words is something you need to decompress, go ahead. Just make sure you focus on the job when we arrive. Matter of life or death, you know." - Victoria requested in a mildly affectionate tone. "Anyway, stoic suit bro, do you have the building plans with the cameras?" - she asked the FBS agent.

"They should have sent it to you on the way to the airport. Check your messages." - the FBS agent answered.

The group swiftly assembled the plan before the plane eventually reached Oroborovsk's airspace.

"We're close." - Adrian observed.

"Sounds about right. Can only see the corners from this angle, what does the famous former Saint Peter's City AKA Lenin's City look like?" - Vici asked.

"It looks like Moscow, but less shittier and less overwhelming. Still looks like shit." - indeed, Oroborovsk was closer to American megapoli from media in terms of the amount of ad billboards.

"If I was the first president of Omnislavia, I would sure as shit be offended by having a city like that named after me." - Victoria smiled.

"I kind of liked Moscow, honestly. The disasterous sensory overload from all the flashing ads was delightful." - Vasil commented with closed eyes. He sounded mildly sleep-deprived at this point.

Victoria made a really gross comparison of central Moscow's visuals to something else. "Vici, sweetie, you forgot about Kate's virgin ears!" - Adrian exclaimed, mostly laughing from the awkwardness, not the comparison itself, his laughter masking his sleepiness. Vici made an awkward face and shut her mouth with her right palm.

"Whoa, whoa! Is that what you were talking about?" - Vasil asked Kate, mildly shocked and amused.

Kate nodded in response with an awkward smile. "It's usually a lot more moderate, it's not often this…" - Kate chuckled awkwardly, with her sleep deprivation making the chuckle even more awkward. "...nasty. She's a special lady."

"Not sure if I qualify as a lady. I guess the minimalistic definition applies." - Victoria commented in a sarcastic tone, even though she was genuine.

The gang landed and traversed the loud, crowded, dirty and generally disgusting airport along with the FBS tough guy, with Adrian, Kate and Vasil chugging 20 bcaps of not-espresso, given how excessive espresso was with near-zero tolerance for Adrian that one time and Vasil that another time. After all 5 of them reached the parking lot, the Starshards entered a fully black car without any markings to drive them halfway along to the destination as planned. "Good luck. Don't forget to report your progress to JB." - the agent told the children before turning around and walking away. Adrian gave him a wave, Vasil gave him a nod and ordered the car to start driving. The streets of Oroborovsk were just like in Murmansk, but more populated, dirty and with more lights from ads everywhere, and the roads were actually noticeably easier to traverse due to less traffic and better roads.

"Man, it feels weird to actually come visit Oroborovsk after all this time. Maybe I should visit one of my friends from here after all of this is over." - Adrian commented as he got back to his phone again, inviting his dating app prey to a more loosely moderated social media site. GoldMine was unfortunately very intolerant and prejudiced to honest scammers like him and Vici, so they needed to manipulate and rob their victims outside of the automod's vigilant metaphorical eye.

"Yea, sounds like a great plan. We could go together on a double d- you know." - Victoria commented with sass, looking at the image of the factory on her phone.

"What are you guys talking about? Do you wanna meet up with some friends from games after this?" - Vasil asked curiously.

"Exactly. We've been making lots of new friends." - Vici falsely affirmed in a patronizing tone.

"Oh, sweet. Kate, why do you look like they're using code for something else?"

Kate made a straight face and put her arms behind her neck. "I don't know what you're talking about. They're clearly making new friends from gaming, that's all there is to it."

Adrian couldn't contain it anymore and snort-laughed. Victoria kept smiling, despite the humor of the situation. "Okay, I guess this is some sort of inside joke I'm not getting." - Vasil disengaged from the conversation calmly.

"Oh, yea. I am an expert in… inside… jokes..." - he burst back into laughter as he tried to say the last word, even dragging Vici along with him to laugh even harder than him. Kate couldn't help but laugh a little too after getting it, despite her best efforts to suppress her own laughter due to embarrassment. Vasil just looked at all of them with confusion, trying to understand the context in vain.

When the car arrived near some random apartment block, the mission crew went outside, and the car drove away on its own back to the airport. Here the darkness of nighttime Oroborovsk was far more noticeable, even though you could still see everything well enough.

"Well, what do you guys think? Car colored in ad vomit, car colored with ad vomit, big car colored with ad vomit, or car colored with ad vomit." - Kate pointed at the options of autos to grand theft with a smug smile.

"Big car colored with ad vomit, I guess. At least the insides aren't covered in it. It's a calamity, honestly. They took beautiful 20th century machinery and turned it into abominable ad vomit, great term, Kate. Race cars in the past had some, sure, but holy \*fuck\*, nowadays it got even worse." - Vasil ranted, setting up a navigator app to guide him from the dark nowhere to the target factory.

"Fun and beauty in life are overrated, anyway." - Victoria said before proceeding to embrace Adrian for no reason in particular, as if the cynical sarcasm in the sentence wasn't obvious enough.

Vasil then began unlocking the target jeep with some unusual tools as everyone walked around aimlessly and waited for him, not paying attention to the process. He finally got in, not turning on any of the electronics in the car, positioned his phone with the navigator on the car control panel \*verify wording\* and unlocked the doors to the side. "Get in." - he said in a stereotypically masculine tone, barely resisting the urge to honk just because he could. As everyone got in, he continued, "Turns out, I needed to start this one in fully analog mode so there's no logs or anything. Meaning, I'm gonna need to manually drive it to our destination." - Victoria, Adrian and Kate all buckled up one by one in that order, despite never doing that previously due to nobody being there to remind them (and due to road accidents becoming much less common with the standardization of self-driving cars). "Wow. Waaaaaaaaow." - he said before buckling up aswell.

Despite everyone's mild worries, the "borrowed" group arrived near the destination completely unscathed, with Vasil parking the car by the side of the road opposite of the factory in an inappropriate place. He stopped the engine, but didn't lock the car. After leaving the car, the Starshards observed the surroundings: among buildings of unknown purpose stood the target factory with a giant red-and-purple Qotton of Quality logo, with the words being stacked vertically and "of" being really small. The surrounding streets were completely deserted, and walls half an alligator high with barbed wire on top surrounded the factory, barring the front gate and the garage-like door to the right of it, with signs on walls saying blah blah, secure area, don't trespass. The factory windows were blocked with black bars. Kate returned everyone the pistols with silencers she attached on the way.

"Looks like we could make a circle around the factory and scan it with our beloved psychic vision. There's no cameras outside, right?" - Adrian asked, focused on the task.

"Only the one for the front gate. Let's go." - Victoria affirmed.

"Two science-defying pairs of eyes are about to crack this case open." - Vasil said with confidence. Adrian made a fist in agreement.

The group started going in a clockwise circle behind Adrian and Vasil around the factory's walls past a human-sized door in the back, and as they crossed it, the boys started sensing an anomaly. Their movement slowed down, and his expression turned to surprise for Adrian and shock for Vasil. As Adrian turned the corner, he stopped and said:

"It's definitely the right place. I sense some insane clusterfuck forward and below us." - as in, to the right of the factory looking at the entrance, under the surface. "Can you sense it?"

"Yea… It's like I can feel them singing an orchestra of agony." - Vasil noted with a disturbed expression.

"Yup. There's 8 humans and a lot of clusters of stressed animals, cats or dogs, I can't tell. Don't think I've ever felt a greater concentration of agony in one place." - Adrian explained in a slightly surprised and muffled but otherwise perfectly neutral tone.

"Oh, the cunts responsible for this are gonna get what's coming to them." - Kate whispered loudly. "Wait, is it even safe to talk here?"

"It should be." - Victoria said in her normal, already somewhat quiet voice, sending a TLDR of the boys' observations to JB.

"Wait, how can you tell if they're human or animal?" - Vasil asked.

"I don't know how to explain. They feel smaller. It's force of habit, I guess. I could teach you to tell them apart later." - Adrian offered.

"That'd be great! Maybe I can learn new powers that way somehow too."

"Guys, guys. Too loud. Also, stay focused." - Victoria reminded.

"Okay, okay. So, does the wall mean we're launching a frontal assault, or?" - Vasil asked, also in a muffled voice.

"No, the original plan to go over the walls should work with some adjustments." - Vici assumed the factory to be surrounded with a thin metallic fence instead of this juggernaut of an outer wall. "We just need an ice ladder to go over the wall in a spot without cameras instead of cutting the fence open, but I don't have enough ice to make it over the walls and cover the barbed wire. I knew I should've brought a backpack full of ice in case something like this happened." - Vici thought aloud. "I know the back door isn't an option either, there's definitely a camera overlooking it."

It didn't take long for the group to decide to drive the car to a nearby store, buy around 15L of drinking water for the ladder to have a good surplus and leave Adrian behind near the factory to make sure nothing happened to the under-factory full of animals. Vici felt safe about him, as he turned on his sneaky neck camera to project to transmit the footage of him being apprehended to JF in real time, plus he was plenty capable of defending himself against lightly armored humans. Unfortunately, the store Vasil found in the navigator app wasn't open in the middle of the night, and so the trio has decided to break into it to steal a 5L bottle each, adding another felony into their lists, just so they could steal a few hundred bears worth of water. Well, at least it would've been a felony if they weren't Starshard. And to top it all off, there was an actual 24/7 store 15 alligators down the road.

"That has gotta be the most insane single thing I've ever done in my life." - Kate commented with disbelief as Vasil was driving her back, also baffled by what just happened.

"I'll admit, that was hilarious, insane and really stupid, but try not to lose even more focus. We still have a job to do." - Victoria asked with a self-deprecating smile, her arms on the stolen water bottles sharing the back seats with her.

"Alright, boss, alright." - Kate commented sarcastically.

"We should probably keep this from Adrian." - Vasil commented, and Kate nodded.

"I think the fuck not, it's something right up his alley, he'll love it. I agree about keeping it from him \*before\* we're done, of course." - Vici said, thinking this wasn't the right time for sharing funny stories.

After bringing the water back to Adrian, who sat through the wait in one piece without any issues, the group put on their stealthy neck cameras and helped Victoria assemble a tall ice ladder from shapeshifted water in the correct entry point to the left of the entrance. The ladder ended up thin, but not thin enough for a late pre-teen to not fit on it. With the help of Adrian's bionic arm, Vici put up the ladder against the wall, climbed atop of it, covered the barbed wire with ice, arranged 2 ice handles to make the way down less deadly, descended back outside and said, "Put on your gloves, go to the top, turn around, grab the handles, hang off the wall and drop down. Try to land properly and not break your legs."

The children went over the wall through the ladder as instructed, carefully dropping to the ground one by one to avoid breaking their ankles, Vici going last in case something went wrong (without gloves, obviously) and melting off the ice through the wall after she was done, in case something went wrong. Surprisingly, there was just enough ice in the 3 stolen water bottles to arrange the entrance. Thankfully, it didn't need to go two ways.

After entering the premises of the factory, Victoria saw the main building towering over the group with large windows on it. Thanks to careful calculations, precise camera locations and building plans, she managed to pick a perfect blind spot to not let any cameras on the inside pick up the footage of the crew going over the wall. There were two sheds between the factory itself and the walls, some slim pipes on the ground and other objects of no importance. The ground near the factory building itself was covered in what appeared to be concrete.

As per the plan, Vici signaled the rest of the gang to follow her into a nearby windowless shed, which was thankfully plenty within range of the blind spot of the cameras. There was a dormant generator inside and other machinery, and no security equipment.

"This is the part where we need to figure out how to reach the underground facility. The plan for this case scenario was to take one of the guards hostage and force them to lead us to the facility. What are your readings on guards, Adrian, Vasil?" - Victoria asked after everyone went inside.

"There's still one guarding the entrance, two leaning against the wall opposite of us, one way above the surface, though according to the architectural structure, that's most likely a white collar worker staying up late, the rest are in the cat torture basement." - Adrian explained. "The way I see it, there's a good chance the dude above is more likely to know about the secret compound, but he'll also take more time to reach, plus he could run away… Yea, we probably better off head for the two guards and kindly and tactfully ask them if they know something." - at this point Vasil has decided that Adrian was doing just fine scanning everything on his own, and just followed along with everyone from now on, and everyone else was too focused to notice.

"Makes sense. I am thinking I cuff them both, see if they lead us where we need, and if they refuse, you can start slowly making their legs more metal than flesh until they talk. They couldn't resist that." - Victoria thought aloud with her left index finger under her nose.

"Jesus fuck, Vici. Aren't you a master of letting people open up without such measures?" - Kate asked, shocked. Vici always managed to surprise her with new ways of being herself. Vasil was also a little disturbed, even if he didn't show it.

"Seriously, Kate? Remember, we agreed to assume they have a way of destroying the evidence before we could get to it, so every second counts. And once we reveal ourselves, every second counts, so this kind of terror is a surefire way to extract information from them in as little time as possible." - Victoria explained with mild frustration. "We were given orders to minimize casualties, not minimize damage. Hell, the plan allows us to avoid casualties altogether if none of them resist detainment."

"I'm gonna have to agree with her, Kate. She makes a point." - Vasil noted.

"Wait, wait, wait…" - Adrian raised a finger. "Someone's ascending from the animal abuse room up into the main factory." - everyone waited in suspense for a while.

"Well?"

"Wait, he's near the surface…" - everyone waited some more. "Yep, he just reached the surface, and is a bit behind and to the right of the two guys from earlier." - Adrian finally announced.

"If I remember the map correctly, that place has 2 cameras pointed right at the rooms where he just exited from, right?" - Kate observed.

"Yes. Seems like you got your wish, Vasil, we'll need to go guns blazing." - Victoria said, walking around the shed.

Kate, Vasil and then Adrian pulled out their pistols and removed safeties on them. "The vending machine is ready to dispense some \*justice\*." - Kate said with pride and determination.

I am thinking we sneak around until we can get a clear shot of the guard duo, detain them, go to the evil Christian basement and pray for no androids. Adrian would lead the way, in case someone moves. What do you think?" - Victoria asked him.

"Sounds good. Want me to try to arrest them as an agent of FBS or MOL or keep pretending we're robbers?" - he asked, standing near the door outside, ready to leave.

"Hmm… Ah, fuck it. Maybe they'll surrender easier that way. Lead the way, tough guy." - Vici teased him.

Adrian nodded and left the shed, went closer to the main building, crouched under windows to avoid being seen by cameras from inside and approached a fire exit door, the rest of the group following closely behind. As he pulled the handle on the fire door and then the door itself, still out of sight of the cameras on the inside, it didn't open. He tried again and again, but it defiantly stayed locked. "Come on, come on… What the hell?" - he asked in a muffled voice and eventually stopped trying.

"What the hell indeed. Why the fuck wouldn't it be open?" - Victoria asked quietly with confusion. Everyone put away their pistols.

"Probably because there's no fire right now." - Kate shrugged, unable to help herself.

"I guess that makes sense, what kind of a fire would start in the middle of the night?" - Vici, along with everyone, couldn't tell it was a joke.

Adrian leant against the left side of the door, fist against his chin. "How the fuck do we even get in? If the doors aren't open and the windows are blocked off, then the only option we have left is trying to break open the flimsiest door we can find and gamble for it to work." - he thought aloud.

Vasil approached the door and looked behind it through the tiny strip. "That's a really shitty gamble. We're probably better off finding a good line of sight somewhere to shoot the guards and threaten them into letting us inside." - Vici suggested, looking around for anyone approaching, even though Adrian had the power to sense that with no problem.

"Guys, guys. I can see something blocking the door from the inside. We could try lifting it up through the door, what do we have to lose?" - Vasil stood upright and looked at the rest of the group.

"You mean the one locking the door or something which isn't in the dead middle?" - Vici asked.

"Yes, above and below the dead middle. Something thicker than the usual locks, can't tell what's the material though."

"You might be onto something." - she reached for an ice maraca in her coat and made a really thin strip of ice around 2 beer cans long, found one of the things blocking the door above the middle and smacked it from below. It went up, then back down. She then smacked it again but harder, then it disappeared and from the sounds of it, something wooden fell on the floor behind the door. "Nice." - Victoria said with pleasure. She also wanted to comment on how sometimes even dumb people did smart things, but deemed it best not to.

"Nice indeed. You might have saved this whole deal, Vasil." - Kate also noted, and Adrian nodded, putting a pleasant grin on Vasil's face.

Vici removed the other piece of wood blocking the door after a few tries, half-pulled the door handle, but stopped and signaled Adrian to do it instead with a hand motion. "Moment of the truth." - she said, shifting the used ice back into a maraca and holding it with one hand.

Adrian took the lead again and opened the door, stepping over two thin planks blocking the door and entering a room full of boxes, shelves and a few other miscellaneous storage room items. The room stretched left for a decent couple of alligators. He closed the door after everyone went inside. "You could have asked, you know." - Kate whispered.

"Good point." - Adrian whispered back, walking to the entrance calmly across the concrete floor, knowing there were no cameras in the room. However, they were about to finally enter the real factory, meaning it wouldn't take long before they were detected. He pulled out a pistol in his coat and watched everyone else pull out theirs, except Vici who pulled out another ice maraca from her coat. Adrian then crouched, quietly counted down "One, two, three", opened the door with his left hand and went inside, beginning to quickly crouch through the maze of conveyor belts, machines and other weird bullshit scattered across the factory, staying out of sight of guards. Around 4 seconds after opening the door, an alarm started going "ee ee ee ee ee", which startled the group a little with how quickly the cameras saw the group, but nobody really lost composure. As the two guards went in the general direction of the children, Adrian popped out from behind a large machine, stood up and aimed his pistol with the right hand at the approaching guards from around 7 alligators away, both around 30 and both with pistols in holsters. "Hands in the air! Reach for that gun and your soul will be reaching for heaven!" - he commanded, putting on the angry mask again. The guards reached for their pistols anyway, so Adrian shot the left one clean in the head, tried to shoot the right one with the second bullet but missed, and successfully landed the third headshot. Shortly prior to firing the last bullet, everyone heard one of the guards' pistols firing, and the bullet produced a loud metallic sound somewhere behind Adrian. He then signaled the crew to stand back up with a hand movement and ran towards the same person who came from below the factory.

The children followed Adrian into a different room to the right of the two dead security guys. It looked pretty much identical to the other storage room, and there was an asian-looking man carrying several crates somewhere in the direction of the factory's entrance away from the Starshards like there wasn't an ongoing security alarm in the building.

"On your knees!" - Adrian commanded. The Starshards all aimed their guns at the worker, except Vici of course. "Or you could die a hero, it's up to you."

The man put down the crates and got on his knees, with hands behind his back. Vici approached him to put ice handcuffs on him to capitalize on his force of habit. "Let's get this over with faster, I don't want a fine for not doing my job in time."

"There's an underground facility full of valuables somewhere connected to this factory. Where is it?" - Adrian asked aggressively.

"I don't know what you're talking about." - he said with very obviously insincere flatness.

Victoria shattered an ice maraca into the back of the man's head. "Let's get this over with faster." - she said with a sinister tone and entombed the man's entire exposed part of the face (except eyes and mouth) in ice, causing him to gasp in pain.

"They'll kill me if I talk. In the most painful way they can think of." - the man admitted, speaking in a quick, strained voice.

"And if you don't talk, the abovementioned fate will feel like a vacation in coastal Baltics in comparison. Still willing to hold your tongue?" - Victoria went around him to slightly bend over and look him in the eyes with an intimidating smile.

"I found it! Didn't even need to turn any suspicious candles or anything, it's right here." - Kate said, taking off a thin vinyl cover painted to look like concrete from the floor and exposing a massive trapdoor around 80 square beer cans in area. Her attempts to open it were unsuccessful. Vici removed the ice mask from the cuffed adult and put away the ice from the mask back in her pockets.

Adrian looked around in case there were any cameras around, found one dangling off at the opposite end of the room, destroyed it with two well-aimed shots from his pistol to reduce his chances of being recorded by the enemy, and announced:

"4 humans standing still near the entrance in different locations. Probably preparing to ambush us."

"Are we even safe to open the trapdoor?" - Vasil asked.

"Yes. It's actually not dying once we get down which might be problematic. Guessing they'll shoot to kill, so no Die Hard bullshit would work." - the room was filled with the silence of thinking Starshards.

"We could… No, actually…" - Vici cut herself off.

After a short while, an idea crossed Adrian's mind. He took off his camera necklace and put it on the hostage's neck.

"Wait, what are you-" - Victoria started asking before Adrian cut her off with a loud "tssss" and an index finger against the mouth gesture. She made a sharp inhale of catching on the plan and nodded, while Kate and Vasil stared at them, confused.

"I got this, just trust the process." - Adrian showed his comrades an open left palm. "Adult guy," - Adrian started reloading his pistol - "Open the trap door and you'll come out of this unscathed. Otherwise," - he finished loading it and aimed it at the worker - "You'll get Kamenev's treatment. Or Yezhov's treatment." - he could have also referenced Nikolai the Second, Zinoviev or Che Guevara (if he knew who he was), or anyone else with the cause of death being execution by firing squad.

After successfully coercing the man into submission with only a few more sentences, he and Kate successfully lifted up the trapdoor, exposing a reasonably long concrete staircase with a closed metal door at the bottom. The worker went in front with hands behind his neck, followed by Adrian pointing a gun at him, Vici, Vasil and Kate. The adult slowly opened the door and sprinted somewhere 1 level below as instructed by Adrian earlier. The plan was for him to sprint near all the incriminating evidence and catch everything on Adrian's camera, preventing the enemy from destroying the evidence before it was too late in case there was a sophisticated panic button, and the plan worked perfectly. Adrian observed with his life-vision as one of the enemy gunmen planning to ambush the crew took a step forward after the sprinting adult from earlier before realizing it wasn't the attackers, and stepped back into the place where they were standing earlier.

Adrian continued standing at the bottom of the stairway. This was the part where he was meant to order whoever is left to surrender, since the Starshards were free to reveal their real affiliation, but he was stuck thinking of the punchiest words to choose. As he was thinking, another gunman, who was standing slightly left of the door, rushed out of cover to presumably get a drop on him, but like in the fake bakery from earlier, being able to see through the walls helped him see it with way more time than needed to react (along with very loud footsteps). Adrian telepathically whispered to the man, "Barry is a rat! Shoot him!". The telepathic whisper was ignored, partly because there wasn't any Barries the target knew. Regardless, when he showed himself in the doorway, he was instantly was shot in the arm and then once more in the shoulder, causing him to fall backwards on the floor, dropping unconscious. He had an assault rifle in his hands and was wearing a protective black vest, a pair of headphones and a blue shirt, unlike the now-dead guards above. The moment the gunshot was heard, a horrendous cacaphony of animal screams started gradually appearing and slowly becoming louder and louder.

"This is FBS! You are under arrest!" - Adrian finally decided to not overengineer it, still aiming the pistol at the doorway. The Starshards waited in suspense for anything to happen, but aside from a few muffled masculine voices too quiet to understand, nothing happened.

"What's the holdup?" - Vici got closer to him and asked quietly. Vasil and Kate got closer too: there was plenty enough space for them to fit.

"Bastards are camping the corners. They didn't move much since I popped the one in the doorway. What are they even trying to achieve?" - Adrian answered, also muffling his voice. Everyone did their best to ignore the terrifying animal screeches coming from the doorway.

"Maybe they don't believe you. Hmm…" - Kate noted quietly.

"Would really hate to call the cops on this. We're so close." - Victoria remarked tensely, accidentally whispering louder than she intended.

"Wait, why can't we sprint in there and shoot everyone?" - Vasil asked with 2 voice cracks.

"Because we'll die. We might die. Hmm… Actually, would we?"

"Guys, guys, I got it. Vasil, do you see all 3 guys?" - Adrian asked, putting down his pistol arm.

"Yea." - Vasil replied.

"When I give you my go, hit them with your sadness emotion power, whatever you call it. Go as hard on them as you can."

"But how can I know what guy am I supposed to target? I can only target one at a time." - Vasil answered slightly louder than intended, though thanks to the alarm continuing to go off and the demonic animal wailing he wasn't heard by the enemies.

"Thumbs up means the leftmost guy, index finger up means middle guy, middle finger means rightmost guy."

"Wait, how does… Okay, got it."

Adrian made Vasil repeat the request to make sure he got it, and then telepathically whispered to the leftmost gunman in the cover in a low-pitched intimidating voice:

"This is the FBS using telepathic satellites to tell you to drop your weapon and surrender. Otherwise we will be forced to use an experimental superweapon on you, side effects of which include brain damage, hearing loss, formation of tumors and overall a very slow and painful death. You have three seconds. Two. One." - Adrian gave Vasil a thumbs up. In a few seconds, he started hearing pained groans, then screams from the underground facility. He could feel how his target fell on the floor and how the other two moved a little, presumably to peek on what was going on with their comrade.

"Stop! STOOOOOOOOOOOOOP! I SURRENDER! PLEASE, NO MORE!" - was finally heard.

"That's enough for now." - Adrian told Vasil. "Surrender yourselves now and we will not liquify your brains the same way we almost did with your comrade." - he told both of the other adults.

\*blabla they surrendered, then got detained\*

"I've got them. Go on without me, I probably wouldn't be able to help much anyway." - Adrian said, hip-aiming his pistol at ice-cuffed guards. He didn't have time to explain it now, but due to the nature of his life-vision it was hard to use it with so many beings in a single "ray" of sight. \*verify comprehensibility\* "Give 'em hell!" - he forgot to take into account that he had a bionic arm and could therefore do a lot more than Vasil. Oh well.

The rest of the children started finally descending into the facility proper after standing on the staircase for so long. "We will. Now, watch out, he said there were 8 earlier, one of them is dead, three more arrested, one more unlikely a combatant, so that leaves 3 more potential hostiles. Vasil, for fuck's sake, where is your gun?" - Victoria observed.

"Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder." - Vasil pulled out his pistol again. Kate didn't need the same reminder.

When they went through the doorway over the unconscious and possibly dead body of a security guard from earlier, they saw tons of filled plastic boxes nearby, some of which smelled foul, but beyond them, they were on the upper of the two floors of a reasonably huge hall where everything was crudely painted white or yellow. Behind the rails of the second floor, they could see weird mechanisms connected to innumerable glass cages filled to the brim with pissed-off animals of all types: cats, dogs, bunnies, there was even an adult sheep playing dead in a far away cage somewhere. Some of them looked like they were ready to bit off all the Starshards' necks, even if they weren't the right species to do that, while others were just lying on the floor, dissociated. The kids looked at the whole thing at the corner of the railings in utter terror, except Vici who was too devastated by the volume and the high frequency to really feel the scenery. "Sweet Jesus, this is awful… Can we please get this done with faster, I hate this…" - she requested. Vasil, on the other hand, was a bit ashamed to admit he liked the sound, even if the cause of it disturbed him as much as it did everyone else.

"Fuck, I am losing focus. Left or right?" - Kate asked, realizing there was no time for a reaction about something disturbing.

"What?" - Vici and Vasil both asked one after the other.

"What do you mean what? I meant do we go left or-" - Kate was cut off by a sight of 2 extra gunmen coming out from the right with assault rifles pointed at the group. "DUCK!" - the group took cover around the corner behind animal cages while under fire. Right before she was safe, one of the bullets managed to hit Kate's side of the body. "Fuck, they clipped me… Oh god…"

"How bad is it, do you think you could shoot them?" - Victoria asked, her voice full of pain too.

"Yea… But I might get clipped again and then… I…"

"I have a plan. Just swap places with me and peek out to shoot them when I give you my command in a few seconds." - and so they did, placing Vici least far into cover and Vasil the furthest. "Get ready… Fuck, what a horrible sound…" - Victoria pulled out an ice maraca and shapeshifted it into sharp scissors to cut off a sizable chunk of cloth from around her arms. She then pulled out 2 more ice maracas and fused them with the scissors into a really large ping pong paddle, then wrapped it around with the circular piece of cloth she cut out from her clothes, all so she could create a visible enough decoy to draw enemy fire.

She peeked it out of cover for a few seconds before the bursts of bullets destroyed it completely. One of the bullets hit one side of the glass cage the Starshards were hiding behind, but the dense layer of animals prevented it from actually hitting any of the children, and the glass didn't actually break from the bullet entirely. "Go! Go! Go!" - Victoria signaled, and so Kate peeked out from behind cover, her training muscle memory kicked in, and she landed a headshot on one of the enemies and a neckshot on the second, all from 3 alligators away, then went down on her right knee to recollect her strength.

"Don't tell me she got them both." - Vasil said with anticipation of Vici telling him what he just asked her not to tell him.

"She wouldn't have remained out of cover if she didn't." - she replied, brushing off the sweat.

"No fucking way."

At the same time, the remaining of the animals in the destroyed glass cage broke through the mountain of corpses blocking their escape path and scattered across the basement, some going upstairs to the actual exit and some not bothering to move at all due to exhaustion. The floor was covered in blood, feces, and even a few carcasses. Kate sat down on the floor against a railing, and other Starshards (besides Adrian, obviously) approached her. Vici went to immediately stop the bleeding with her ice. "Vasil, let's take her and bail. Fuck this. I was wrong. I was so wrong." - she said before they helped her up to leave the basement together.

"I got them though. I fucking got them… I

I don't completely suck…" - Kate said in a strained, yet euphoric voice.

When the trio crossed the guy blocking the doorway again (who was almost certainly dead by this point due to the size of the pool of blood on the floor), Vici shut the door behind them so they didn't have to hear the animal screeches any more. Thankfully, by this point the flow of stressed animals stopped and didn't interfere.

"Let's put her down here, yep." - Vasil said as he and Vici help Kate sit down near the left of the door. Vici sat down herself to the right, Vasil a few steps above her.

"Oooo… I am guessing it didn't go-" - Adrian started, but Vici couldn't hold it any longer and started hyperventilating like one would after spending 2 minutes underwater without gear. "-well." - he finished. Vasil was trying to silently decompress himself: even though he didn't see much action in the animal abuse basement, this was way more action and danger than he was used to.

"I am a fool. An idiot, a pathetic overzealous idiot. I didn't consider my biological inferiority as a huge factor and got fucked completely… AAAAAAAAAAAGH-FUCK, why didn't I think we should call in the cops right when I realized it was a problem… Perfect plan with all the failsafes my ass."

"I…" - Adrian didn't know how to find the words.

"I should have known that thousand bears an hour was too good to be true." - one of the detained gunmen commented.

"I didn't even have a choice, I was blackmailed to work for them! Kids, I hope you're learning good lessons from our mistakes. Don't sell out to the big corpo. If you have to sell out, you better choose the government." - another added.

"Doesn't the government control what you call the big corpo?" - Adrian asked. What followed was a long, tense silence. Everyone waited for the detainee to continue the conversation, waiting for what felt like years, but it was not to be. Eventually, a pretty massive group of people in black armor with FBS written both on the front and back of their torsos in white went onto the staircase. Two of them led the prisoners upstairs somewhere, the rest went to finish the job for the Starshards. A few more seconds after that, Adrian's dad \*verify if it's him or Jason's parents which are in town\* entered the staircase and led the children outside the factory through the front door.

\*fix gun volume logic so all guns ever used in buildings are pneumatic\*

When they left the building, they saw a couple of police vans, black cars and ambulances outside. A security guard was being dragged off to a police car, Vasil, Vici and Adrian were (voluntarily) put into the back seats of a black sedan to be driven to a nearby hotel to rest the night. Kate was carried to an ambulance instead.

"I know it may not feel like it, but you four were amazing. You handled the stress of a covert op as well as you could have. The trick to put your necklace on a collaborationist and send him running back downstairs to capture all the evidence? That takes wits, you won the operation there and then. So proud of you, son. Proud of all four of you, to be frank." - Adrian's dad claimed.

Adrian nodded. "Whatever. I can't believe I got broken down by a noise of all things, realized it, and still decided to keep squeezing blood from a boulder." - Victoria remarked, frowning with her arms crossed and staring into the darkened streets of Oroborovsk.

"That's not very fair to yourself, we all handled ourselves great until that point. You know, this has been on my mind for a while now: we suck at accepting our limits and knowing when to quit." - Adrian said, putting his arm behind Vici's back, also staring at the darkened apartment blocks outside. "We're wired to prioritize the absolute degree of success and ignore our own wellbeing. I can see it so clearly now that I stayed behind and didn't have to endure the main load of that… wail."

"I wouldn't even call that punching above your weight, she did great inside the basement proper. She was ambushed by terrorist combatants, managed to get in cover without getting shot, quickly improvised what soldiers call a peek-a-boo to pull off the craziest double-team takedown of the enemies that you can imagine, then patched her up and carried her back to the staircase. All while under the effects of a nightmarish sensory overload." - his dad recited. He sounded more joyful than Adrian has ever remembered him being.

"You did WHAT?" - Adrian turned to Vici and asked her with awe. She continued sulking.

"It's true, I was there. They locked the fuck in and did it." - Vasil affirmed. Just like everyone besides Vici, he was pretty content with how everything unfolded.

"Maybe it was pretty cool since you framed it that way. I just wish there was anything I could do to prevent this from happening in the future, but from my understanding, it's a weakness coded into my biology." - she said sadly.

"As a matter of fact, it's a weakness which is perfectly possible to amend with modern medicine." - Adrian's dad said with a sly tone.

"Wait, how? It's how my brain interprets this which is a problem from my understanding, and I am pretty sure there's no AI-era medicine which can physically rewire someone's head."

"Nobody said rewiring your head was needed. All that's needed is to replace the input device with something more modern, specifically programmed as a vaccine against most sensory overloads. In fact, every special agent, high ranking military officials and more get this technology as protection against sonic weapons."

"Can I have it early?" - Victoria asked with a rare tone of genuine mirth. She even felt a little embarrassed for how much she wanted it.

\*verify if i made adrian struggle with this hypersensitivity, add him asking for it too if true\*

"Well, did you succeed doing what we requested?"

She took a deep breath. "Yes."

"Then you can have it tomorrow evening."

"Phew. Thanks." - she felt a lot more relieved than her near-deadpan voice seemed to indicate.

"You know, I've been wondering… what's gonna happen to the poor animals who we just rescued?" - Vasil asked.

"A lot of them fled to the streets already, and the rest can be adopted by local animal shelters. Some of them might go to the State Virtue Signaling Fund. They'll be relatively fine." - the adult in the car responded, though the children understood that "relatively fine" in this context could mean literally anything.

"Can I take one home with me? I always wanted a dog to take care of, and I'd love to help one of these poor animals. A white one, though. A big white dog." - Vasil requested as Vici gave him a half-ironic side-eye. "That came out wrong, didn't it? I didn't-"

"A white one specifically, mm?" - she asked with a playful tone as Adrian couldn't hold it in any longer and burst into laughter in the middle of her sentence.

"I think it's just that you have a talent for making anything completely normal sound weird. Didn't think Kate was right about that, but she clearly was." - Vasil was also smiling.

"Oh, yea, Kate \*told you\* about that, huh?" - Victoria said after a wicked idea came to her mind.

"Huh? Wait, what did I say? I don't understand."

A couple of seconds of silence was spent as Vici was trying not to burst into laughter and as Adrian was trying to understand what happened. Then he did. "Oooooooh." - and that's when Vici burst into an uncharacteristically loud laughter herself. She has successfully gaslit Vasil into thinking he said something weird again.

Over the course of the night, while the rest of the Starshards involved in the operation were getting some well-deserved rest, Kate was being successfully patched up back to health. The next morning Vici has received bionic ears as promised (entirely internally bionic, they looked perfectly natural from outside), all the while Adrian, Vasil and Kate were doing some chores for one of the local police departments. In the evening, another plane flew them back to Murmansk.

The next day after, Adrian, Kate and Vici have decided to spend their remaining day off from school in the same dusty factory where this entire plotline took root. The first two went at it for hours, all the while Vici was busy brainstorming a new outfit, but eventually Adrian's performance dipped due to mental fatigue, and he went outside to sit on the benches. Vici stood up from sitting on the stairs near the floor and came with, all the while Kate continued hitting her targets with an average accuracy of 7-9 bullets per mag for a while longer. It wasn't the best performance by her standards due to how long this session lasted, but it didn't dissuade her. She was inspired by her success during the operation, and she remembered that determination was how you get shit done.

"Wanna check out a news video about us?" - Vici asked Adrian outside.

"Yea. I actually wonder what happened in the end. I know they sorted it out in the end, but that's about it." - he answered.

"Alright. Man, you were right about bionics. They're awesome. I wish I had this since I was 6. I feel invincible, honestly." - she remarked with a smile while searching the video in question.

"I know, right?"

"I shall fear the demonic screeching of a crying infant in public transport no longer." - Victoria said in a very unusual tone for her.

"Ugh. I think if all of the world's infants went against all of the world's preteens, the infants' mind-shattering wail would annihilate anyone on their way."

Then Vici started screeching like an infant herself, causing Adrian to laugh uncontrollably at both how surreal it was to hear his partner sound like that and how accurate it was. Then the same thing happened but with the two of them swapped, and it continued for around a minute where they both alternated between laughing and aggressively fake-crying until they finally had enough, allowing Victoria to get back to looking for the damn video she set out to find.

When she finally found it, a young white news anchor lady narrated:

"A shocking discovery was made when a FBS investigation revealed that Ron Sharkman, a CEO of a major state-owned enterprise has been housing production of knowingly poisonous food right in his basement! He has been distributing them personally for the purpose of poisoning as many proud Omnislavians as possible. Ron Sharkman, originally born in former European Confederation, has been revealed to have been paid off by the Turkish government to spread discord and terror in our lovely country…"

"Wait, what? That doesn't make any sense." - Adrian noted with confusion.

"Because it's not real. They've given the news outlets a story which allows them to piggyback hatred against foreigners on it." - Victoria didn't seem at all displeased. "But I mean, still, we did something that hit the news! And not just local news from Murmansk, but all the news!"

"...date of execution by lingchi for Ron Sharkman on the grounds of grand treason, corporate mass murder, corruption, tax evasion, supporting communism, supporting liberalism, supporting capitalism, drug trafficking and more is set to the 6th of June 2092. Next up, experts say that external immigrants might be infested with hyper-ebola. But is it India or Europe who uses bio-weaponry because they hate Omnislavia, or perhaps both and Turkey on top of them?" - the news report continued.

"Ninety two? Man, they just wanna edge out his death for as long as possible. Though, I guess anything really could be happening behind the scenes."

"Yea… Hope you don't mind a sharp turn on our conversation-" - Adrian started before getting interrupted by Vici.

"Never." - she paused the video and put away her phone. Both of them started staring at the snowy streets.

"Okay. Just, if we look back at how we started when we first, it's kinda obvious that we adapted to this life really well. It seems like us and the military have established a healthy enough dynamic. Everything actually looks bright, for once! And not just because snow is making everything bright."

"Heh. I love snow. It's sticky, abundant and beautiful when you zoom in really deep. Not unlike someone else I know." - she was waiting for the right opportunity to say that in a conversation for more than a week.

"Hmmm… Beautiful when you zoom in… What are you talking about? I am lost a little."

"God damn it, Adrian. I meant you. Take the fucking compliment." - she smiled.

"Oh, I get it. Thanks. Wait, why am I sticky?"

"Because we stick together." - Victoria's tone turned 180 degrees. "Actually no, why are you overthinking this? Take the compliment. Savour it. Embrace it. Do you feel loved and appreciated?" - I don't know how would I describe the tone she said that with.

"Yes?" - Adrian didn't know any way to properly play into it, even if he found the bit amusing. In terms of being a goofy goober, Victoria still surpassed him.

"Good!" - Vici said before a door was heard opening behind them, and Kate approached the duo shortly after.

"Heyyy, there's the gunslinger!" - Adrian greeted her.

"Still kicking out there?" - Victoria asked, switching focus from her phone onto Kate completely.

"Yea! Just wanted to be near you guys for a bit before getting back to it." - Kate sat down near Vici.

"You know, ever since that day, every time I am near you, I have this strange sensation of happiness and inspiration. I don't really know why." - Victoria admitted.

"What she's trying to say is, she's very proud of you. We both are." - Adrian translated.

"Yes." - she nodded in approval.

"Awww, you guys!" - Kate felt complimented.

"I suck at taking failures. They always make me feel really frustrated in the moment, even if I can rationalize them and correct the reason why they happened. But something inside you just seemed to click. Your failures don't disorient you, and you keep pushing like nothing happened." - Vici closed half of her face with a stretched out palm to not look Kate in the eye. "It feels weird to say this, I feel so wrong to think so, but… You're a certified badass." - Victoria opened her face and looked Kate in the eyes. Kate didn't answer anything, but the tears of joy on her face served as an answer in itself.

Adrian got an idea what to add to the conversation further. "By the authority of… myself, I pronounce you an honorary Starblood." - he couldn't think of other words.

"Oh, good call. We already treated her like one, may aswell make it official. Ish." - as Vici was saying this, Kate wiped the tears off her eyes.

"Well, we should probably give Kate a bit of a rest from excessive glazing. We wanted to tell you something we discovered with Adrian very recently. Remember the conversation about Christians?"

Kate took a moment to recompose herself. "Yea?"

"We have discovered the inconsistency between the alleged intentions of every religion to extort money or power from people and the practices of Holy Paw to sell poison to people in our first conversation about this. And the reason behind it is that our original interpretation doesn't make any sense. As it turned out, Holy Paw specifically wanted to poison people as a part of its doctrine. The adults told Adrian, umm..." - Vici forgot the exact wording and stumbled.

"Yea, the guy who was arrested over this was the top donor of the organization and the leader's best friend. Friend of Michael the First. Wait, that's not… Yea, the doctrine basically proposed that the members of the cult poison themselves so they can achieve salvation and cure of all mental illnesses through physical struggle." - Adrian recited.

"So they never were after the money in the first place. And through this discovery and additional research we developed the complete theory of religion. The religious often point out how others' worship doesn't match up with their religious text and in extreme cases demonize said differences as heresy, all the while missing a lot of important details of the dogma itself."

Kate smiled. "Nerds. Can you give me an example? I don't really understand what you mean."

"There's a million. You know Turks and how they force women to wear ninja gear over their faces?" - Vici put one of her legs over the other. Both Adrian and Kate wheezed a little, and even Victoria herself couldn't resist a smile. Kate nodded instead of answering. "There's nothing about that in the Qur'an, the Muslim religious dogma. You can verify it yourself."

After Kate finally recovered, trying not to lose the train of thought, she commented, "Huh. That colors the hijabs in a completely different light. Isn't that just Muslims though? "

"That's the thing. It's everyone. Every religion. Pretty much everyone has their personal, even if heavily influenced interpretation of religion with minor differences. Hell, the Bible allegedly has a lot of vague quotes which could be interpreted either way: all of theism is built on personal interpretations, whether the person likes it or not. The system of denominations and religions and schisms is a massive overgeneralization of reality's raw chaos. "

"Don't worry, the sciency words will end soon and there will be one single cool phrase which can sum it all up." - Adrian reassured Kate, noticing that she is struggling to pay attention.

"Yea, we just got to it: you can't safely assume anything about anyone purely based off of their declared religion. Not all Christians are exploitative pieces of shit: just because a loud minority were, doesn't mean all are." - Victoria finally ended it. Adrian made a slow explosion gesture with his hands: he also participated in coming to this conclusion.

"Oooh. I like that, actually." - Kate approved.

"By that logic, using religion as justification for anything is also circular logic." - Adrian also added.

"Okay, I can't keep up with the conversation anymore. Too many thoughts in my head!" - Kate proclaimed quickly in a joyful tone.

"What thoughts?"

"How awesome my friends are, mainly! And how awesome I feel about myself."

"Probably not as awesome as how we feel about you." - Vici fired back.

Adrian's ringtone rang over her, and shortly after he picked up the phone and put it on a loudspeaker.

"Yo", said Jason, Adrian, Vici and Kate only a fraction of a second from one another.

"Just wanted to ask you what you think about this cool medical thing I found out about. It's called a Lavrov Multiple Wave Oscillator, and it basically cheers up your sad cells in your body and makes them behave better, preventing cancer and curing many problems, including mine! I was told my brain cells were saddened." - Jason explained over the phone.

"And have you checked the public information about this device to see if biology even remotely works that way?" - Victoria answered in an irritated, intentionally flat tone.

"No, but I was told the big pharma doesn't want us to know about this and therefore does whatever they can to spread disinformation about it on the internet and in education. It's totally within their power, right?"

Kate made an exasperated sigh. Adrian commented with a little less exasperation, "Goddammit, Jay."

All the while Vici bent her neck backwards to face the sky and said emptily, "Maybe if my existence proves that God doesn't exist… What if that also proves Satan certainly does?"

S2E9 Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained

A few weeks have passed since the Starbloods directly caused the downfall of the second deadliest, absolute most dangerous cult in human history. The children kept working, fighting ethically neutral or even positive yet legally serious crimes, doing their best to sidestep school and focus on literally anything else. Vici has finally gotten herself a more practical upgrade in terms of clothing: it was a set of pure white clothing with a long-sleeved shirt and a cape with a nearly identical pattern to Vici's long dress she allowed to constrict herself for so long, and still kept the ice crown from the first book. The outfit had tons of pockets on them with even more room to store ice than before. She has decided to also move on to directly storing ice in her clothes in large chunks instead of in maracas or ice balls, since it no longer took significant energy to shapeshift a part of that ice into a ball or a maraca anymore, further improving storage efficiency. Overall, it was a great upgrade which made it unnecessary to have several outfits for combat and non combat, and made her look like a proper anti-heroic fighter that she was.

One day, all 4 of the Starbloods involved in taking down the Holy Paw plus a lot of other Starbloods have attended a hide and seek session they organized prior for this day's long school break. They involved the hiding wearing a green headband and the seekers a red one, and if you got tagged while hiding, you had to switch to a red headband. The only rules were that you couldn't hide in classrooms as that raised the heat, and that you couldn't hide in places you could only access via bribery, since not everyone had access to them.

Vasil and Brian the teenage Starblood walked in a hallway, both with red headbands. "Man, I really thought I was doing something revolutionary by hiding behind a door." - Vasil said, mildly disappointed.

"Don't blame yourself, kiddo. I am the grandmaster of hide and seek, and a previous last one hiding. You didn't have much of a chance. You can just follow me and watch the guru at work, maybe you'll even become the next winner." - Brian tried to cheer up Vasil, in his own way.

"I never actually played it in this group. It should be interesting."

They descended behind the staircases to check them for anyone hiding. All they found was 2 teens sitting cross-legged, with an oversized blue plastic box beside them, probably stolen from the PE class somewhere.

"Hey there! Here to microdose the shrooms again, Vasil?" - one of them asked.

"What?" - he was offended by the question. Someone in the room wheezed a little.

"We're screwing with you, don't worry! Relax, bro! Seriously, what can we do for ya?"

Brian was spending this time to look for anyone hiding behind the door, directly under the staircase. There was noone. "Yea, we're looking for a bunch of people with green headbands somewhere. Know anywhere where we can find them?" - he asked.

"We don't deal in human trafficking, sorry." - the other teen replied in an Italian accent.

"Yea, they would have noticed if they were here. Come on, my apprentice, there's more spots to search."

Vasil did an Omnislavian salute as both of them were leaving. "Let's go, Master!"

A short while after they left, the blue box suddenly burst into intense laughter.

"Is that even allowed by the rules?" - one of the teens beside the box asked.

"Yea, why wouldn't it be? It's not like they \*couldn't\* check the most obviously out of place item in the room. It's all on them." - a feminine voice from the blue box answered.

"Fair enough. You wicked little fellas."

Some minutes after, Bezdon with a red headband came into the under-the-stairs to also search the room. During his search, the blue box made a buzzing sound. Bezdon turned his head to see what was happening, but one of the teens picked up his own phone and pretended to reject the call before putting it away again, so Bezdon didn't pay it much mind. He searched the whole place, ghosted an invitation to buy drugs, and left.

"Phew. Thought we were goners there and then." - the boyish voice from the box said. "Who was it?"

"Oh, it's probably nothing, it's…" - the feminine voice paused. "JF. Claims there is a terrorist attack near the shore of Murmansk… Other Starbloods have been captured… I am invited to join the party and take the rest of the day off of school!"

"Alright! Let's do this- aw, man, only you're invited."

"I doubt you'll be missing out on too much fun. My new skills should be more than a match for them." - the lid of the blue box went up, revealing Adrian and Vici inside with green headbands, knees against their chests. Vici closed the box again for a bit to stay in it for a while longer. "You sure you'll be fine on your own, though?"

"Of course." - Adrian replied. "Might be a little lonely, but I'll find a way to handle myself."

"If it'll be lonely for you, I am not going. I don't want you to feel lonely, that'll cause problems later or might even kickstart something very bad."

"It'll be fine! I'll be fine. You got a golden opportunity to skip school. Don't worry about me, just call me when you're done."

"Okay." - she said quickly before embracing him, though the limited light inside the box made it a little weird. The gesture was still sent and received successfully. "I'll bring you a souvenir. Maybe one of their eyes." - Vici started leaving the box.

"I don't think Kate would take that well if she saw it."

"I am joking! I am not that much of a psychopath." - she smiled. "Is it really so normal in Murmansk? Cutting out someone's eyes for fun?"

"Yea, our curriculum is a breeding ground for blood-thirsty maniacs. I thought the lab was bad enough, but out here it feels like they \*want\* guys like Bezdon to be the norm."

"Not incorrect." - in reality, an eye would have had zero value to either of them as a trophy: they both have executed more people than they cared to count by this point, and they viewed state-sanctioned executions or field killings as just a regular part of their jobs not worth glamourizing. "Oops," - she said as she dropped a 100 bear banknote on the floor, "dropped something." - she didn't pick up the bill.

One of the drug dealer teens took it. "Pleasure doing business with you."

As she walked to the car from the dealers' little corner, taking off the green headband on the way, she kept thinking about what was gonna happen with Adrian and if anything was gonna go wrong. Something about these thoughts, something about this entire predicament, it felt like something went off the rails and was not going as planned, and she couldn't tell what exactly. She even physically felt it in the form of a very foreign, intrusive, uncomfortable feeling.

Some Starblood's stepdad was waiting for Vici to enter the car, and she entered the front seat after confirming the license plate since Kate wasn't around to take it.

"Don't forget to buckle up, I know you have problems with remembering that, and we'll be driving on high gear to our destination." - Vici nodded as a token of appreciation for the reminder, and buckled up. "Here's the drill." - the adult explained, "One of our billionaire's yachts is located not far north of Murmansk, and it was overtaken by domestic terrorists. We don't know what they want exactly, but they're demanding a billion bears in international currency for not killing the hostages and a safe passage from the yacht. Needless to say, the only thing they are entitled to is death or capture."

"Saw something about other Starbloods being in trouble. What's up with that?" - Vici asked. Powerful wind was bending the trees outside the window, and rain droplets forced the driver to occasionally wash the windshield to maintain visibility. 

"I was getting to it. You see, we sent out Bezdon and Lumina to deal with the whole situation. They should have been plenty enough to sort it all out."

"Oh no. Not her." - the last thing Victoria needed was Lumina's antics right now.

"We know about the conflict you kids had together. First she and Adrian were seen together, then she did her best to win a fight against you and kept failing over and over, then finally gave up on it and everyone else at the same time."

"Do you adults track all our movements or something?" - Victoria was a little disturbed by the implication that the adults knew about pretty much everything that happened between them.

"Not all, and even less so in Murmansk. I mean, we didn't even really need to use much AI analysis to know this, all the information was pretty much already available on LabSocial. Some Starshards were even so kind as to piece everything together and write a mini-documentary about it."

"Bet I looked like a cold-hearted badass from the videos and retellings of events. At least that's some comfort." - she smiled, looking up.

"In any case, we didn't want to get you involved in the mission for this reason, but the circumstances have changed. She also won't be happy to see you, but you won't need an escalation into another fight. Just don't engage with her. The reason they were captured in the first place was that our original plan was to send Bezdon and Lumina onto the ship as negotiators and secure the release of the hostages. They were meant to arrive in place and pick the least risky moment they could find to open fire as soon as they saw what's going on with the hostages. However, the activists never wanted to play fair either: both Starbloods were put at gunpoint and forced to surrender even before they stepped foot on the yacht. We never anticipated them to ever do anything this suicidally reckless, I mean, it annihilated cooperation with us as an option completely, leaving their total death as the only way this whole story could have ended." - the adult looked bewildered.

"You sure ransom was their only goal? Maybe they never wanted to ransom anything, but instead were, for example, hired by the Finnish to steal the yacht and the technology that powers it, with the ransom thing being nothing but a cover up?"

"We considered that possibility, yea, but it'd still be extremely reckless for them to go for a play this risky. Maybe I just don't understand how their minds work, or maybe they somehow know something we don't."

The car left Murmansk and drove somewhere northward through spring forests, mostly untouched by nature. It took them surprisingly long to get to the destination, and for the whole duration another black car was tailing Victoria's.

"So, why is there another black car tailing us?" - she asked at some point.

"Good question. Keep looking in the rear mirror." - the driver said.

"Okay?" - she did keep looking in it nonetheless. What she saw was a dense iridescent cloud. "Oh, hell yea." - her mood was elevated, and she shapeshifted a sign from her pocket ice chunks which said "PENIS". By now, she learnt how to give the letters proper volume to give the letters appropriate visibility. "Man, all the strongest Starbloods are participating in the mission, minus Adrian and Vasil, arguably. I'll be a little disappointed if it will be a complete overkill." - she then added more quietly, "Why wasn't Adrian actually invited then?"

"It's a fiercer competition than you think. There's none like you from your lab, but there are a few powerful Starbloods which you don't interact with much. Nathan, for example. He's had a power growth spurt \*verify wording\*, he is making great progress towards becoming an exo-ninja with a steel-melting flameblade." - the adult explained.

"Nathan?... I can't even say anything sarcastic to mock these endeavors. That's badass. Good for him." - Exo-ninjas were an actual military unit from the supersoldier class, with "exo" standing for "exoskeleton-powered", and their goal was to rush the enemy through a blind spot and cleave an entire group of androids or soldiers in seconds.

"Yes, you know the exo-ninja's biggest weakness? Not their armor, they actually get super-expensive, super-powerful armor which most combat units don't have the resources to pierce, it's their sword which is their weakness. A modern flameblade is basically just a stick with several small flamethrowers on it, and the fuel it consumes isn't compact enough to fit inside the weapon itself." - Vici knew how powerful flamethrowers were in the modern era. Only the strongest android armor could withstand 4000 kelvin of pure solar inferno. "Since military insight travels lightning-fast in our modern world, exo-ninjas have to protect the flameblade with their body, as it's much harder to insulate them from damage, it looks quite ridiculous in action. However, Nathan would have an indestructible flameblade powered by Starblood powers, and he'll have no such weakness. If it all works out, he'll become a terrifying killer."

"Cool."

The cars eventually arrived at the village of Ura-Guba (which is a name which almost certainly sounds a lot less wacky for a Baltic). MOL temporarily took over a small harbor to prepare Vici and Brian for entering the operation, and their equipment and vehicles and everything stood out like a sore thumb in the background of near-lawless, rural, isolated Omnislavia. The first thing the Starbloods did when leaving their cars was to approach eachother and give eachother a handshake.

"Happy to work with the military's favorite Starblood!" - Brian said.

"Happy to work with the military's least favorite Starblood, and that's not an insult." - Victoria replied.

"Trust me, it's not even close. They would always rather have a troublemaker who can occasionally make himself worth feeding rather than an obedient waste of skin."
"Good point. Let's do this."
A bald man in a military uniform approached the duo. "The yacht is still sailing westward along the coastline. Your orders are to get on that small boat with an autoturret over there, and it should take you to the yacht." - he then pulled out a tablet with the yacht's satellite view. "This is the standard entrance. Alternatively, there's a chain in the boat, in case you choose to climb up through the side."
Victoria made a frown. "And how do you expect us to even reach the boat as we would be getting shot at? This plan gives them several minutes to shoot both of us in the head."
"Who do-" - the man coughed. "I was getting to that. When you'll be nearing the line of sight of the boat, we will start bombarding it with smokebombs, allowing you smooth passage on board. They might hear the engine, but you'll be equipped with infrared sensors which should give you the tactical advantage needed to survive the boarding. After that, just free the other two Starbloods held at gunpoint along with the rest of the hostages in the engine room, kill or capture all activists, go home and tell the story at a campfire." - the man's voice was uneven, unnatural, a bit strained: it was as if the voice was a beast, held docile by its chains. 
"Is there a vent? I might have an idea." - Brian asked.
"You have the boat's schematics on your phones. Feel free to check on the way."
"Mmm, I see where you're going with this. Do the guys on board know who the Starbloods are?" - Victoria asked, fidgeting around.
"They don't know of their value, no. They do know that Lumina has eye lasers, so they put a blindfold on her."
"Of course. Good to know."
After Brian changed into a tactical suit and  Victoria simply put an appropriately-sized bulletproof vest on under her outer suit, they hopped into the boat with and let it ride them to their destination. They were up for another reasonably long ride, though again, as a reader, you'll only see a small exchange between them, otherwise the pacing would stall. 
"So, have you got any new abilities since last time I checked? With your signature rainbow gas and rainbow gas lightsaber, whatever is the physics behind that." - Victoria asked when they were a quarterway there.
Brian couldn't help but to screw around with the newly-rediscovered liquid the boat was floating over by holding an empty can from a shoplifted beer bottle slightly submerged in it. The back of the boat also made cool ripples. "I learnt how to shoot a concentrated rainbow gust cloud to apply the effect at range. Already got 8 police complaints for playing with it." - he said. They had to speak louder to hear eachother over the boat's loud engine. 
"I bet you did, old timer! I guess the wild events of late 2090 got you to actually progress in your Starblood powers. Not that you needed any more to be a menace to society, am I right?" - Victoria genuinely sounded overjoyed, which was pretty rare for her. She didn't talk much with Brian despite a good degree of mutual respect, but mutual respect there was. 
"Exactly! You know, you're one of the only ones in my entire surroundings who actually approves of my mischief. Everyone else is always so judgey, lecturing me about how mischief and pranks can go too far and sometimes you cross the line into being a dick. Like I don't know what I'm doing." - Brian remarked. 
"Ever heard the old saying, an angler sees a fellow angler from afar? Or, the english equivalent, takes one to know one? Because you better believe it, I've got a track record of my own." - she made a proud smirk.
"Oh yea? How many police disturbance calls did you get hung on you so far?"
"Something in low two digits, but when me and Adrian screw around, we try to mostly stick to long term pranks with slow payoff. Easier to use the alibi of 'they're just making shit up for drama or money'."
"You have to share how it went on the way back. It's gotta be good."
"Definitely not with the boat AI eavesdropping, but after that, sure."
As the boat was around the corner from the destination, the NCAI in control of it notified the Starbloods:
"We're almost to our destination. Do you need any more time to prepare?" - the boat's androgynous voice was unaccented and cold. 
"Just the time to put on our helmets. I already made room for breathing masks for the hostages. Repeat your exact role." - Victoria reassured the boat. Well, technically the boat's AGI was in the cloud. The boat did have an actual on-board AI to direct the turret's targeting, but having the conversation/tactical decision AI directly on board would have been redundant. 

"Drop you off at the yacht's rear. Stand still and wait for you and the hostages. Shoot anyone identified as a terrorist."
"Good." - by now, Vici and Brian finished putting on their bulky tactical helmets with IR vision and a few other visions. "The helmet probably sticks out like a sore thumb relative to the rest of my clothing." - she remarked with a giggling tone.
"It does!" - Brian confirmed.
The boat eventually stopped near a shore. "Ready?" - the boat's voice asked.
"Yup." - the Starbloods asked.
In a few seconds, several small booms were heard behind the shoreline, and the boat moved forward around the shore towards the yacht, shrouded in smoke. Victoria didn't expect it to be as huge as it was, and as the boat moved closer to it, she tried to solve the mystery of why in the fuck would anyone want to own anything like this for personal use. Spoiler alert, the question kept bugging her for weeks and she never found the answer before she stopped caring.
The Starbloods' boat got close to the yacht, and the smoke bombing finally stopped, as the already present smoke was more than enough for the Starbloods to safely enter. Even without infrared's help it was possible to tell where the boat's rear was. Vici and Brian hopped hopped onto the yacht's aft, Brian shot some guy blindly swimming in the water surrounding the yacht with a silenced assault rifle, knowing it couldn't have been a hostage as they were all in the engine room according to intel. As per the plan, the military opened the big door to the maintenence section remotely.
The section of the maintenance room had a panicking activist right outside the worst of the smoke, prepared to shoot or boot. "Hit the guy in front with your new ability, I wanna try something." - Victoria told Brian. After he did his part and she saw how the man got on his knees and dropped the riflr from the shock of such a substance entering his brain, she sprinted out of the fog to quickly get behind him and handcuff him before he turned into a hallucination zombie. Despite Victoria's lacking physical strength due to reliance on ice in combat, she had enough force in her arms to get his arms behind his back and cuff them. She could also see the terrorist clearly without fog now: it was a very young adult wearing light-brown camo with a bulletproof vest on top of it, and also a helmet with a mismatching white camo pattern. She could also see her and Brian's clothes were covered in dark gray from smoke. 
"Nice." - Brian observed, keeping an eye out for anyone else. The maintenance section had a extra rooms in it, and also two thin hallways ahead which led to the engine room where the hostages were held.
"I am sorry, Blood Pony of Zanumbia. I plead guilty for mouse murder and pug apologism." - the man's hallucinations kicked in, and the signature prismatic color entered his eyes. He went properly down on his knees, with his hallucination adapting to him being physically restrained. Victoria started hearing some weird mechanical noises behind her, which in reality were just the military closing the door as the terrorist leader tried to open it back up to be able to send reinforcements when the smoke dissipated.
Brian pulled up his phone to see footage from inside the engine room, recorded by a stealthy robot. "Check this out." - he showed Vici the footage. There were 6 enemy fighters, all wearing helmets with ear protection and uniforms with similarly mismatched camo patterns, sitting behind cover and preparing to ambush anyone who came near, additionally placing hostages they were using in front of their cover to give the strategy an additional human shield element. Bezdon and Lumina were simply lying horizontally face upwards with bags on their faces. 
"I don't know! I don't know anything about that, Miss Margaret Snatcher! I swear, I didn't do it!" - the captured terrorist shouted delusionally, ruining the moment's tension.
"Man, I missed the rainbow gas zombies." - Vici remarked. "They're clearly well-trained, it's an elite tower defense layout they got going. Couldn't have done too much better myself."
"How the hell are we to penetrate this? The hostages are there so we can't rainbow gas. The moment we peek out, we're dead. There's also 6 of them, so no decoys would work." - Brian thought aloud.
"I revoke my allegiance to soup and go all vegan! I will never eat another flower with flesh!" - Vici's hostage undercut tension again with his psychobabble. 
"There's two passages, right? I might have something. Go to the door to the left hallway and hide to its right. When you hear them react to my presence, count 10... No, 8 seconds and blast a couple of them with your rainbow gas gusts, then hide again. Then we wait 8 more seconds and use ensuing confusion to take care of the rest and hope that the guys you hit somehow won't reengage with no issues. You can fire your new spell in quick succession, right?" 
"Yea, I can charge it up to fire two in a row, and no, it's statistically unlikely for them to just swap textures inside their eyes and continue holding the chokepoint like nothing happened." - Brian confirmed. "Let's do this, whatever you have in mind."
"Fighting ice with ice is what I have in mind." - Victoria said before proceeding to force the hostage to stand up and move towards the hallway to the right. Again, she wasn't very strong, so it took a while, and eventually they reached the door. Vici opened the door with her hand and did a peek-a-boo by using the hostage as a decoy.
"Hold your fire! Hold your-" - a protestor started saying loudly before being interrupted by gunshot spread, though none of the bullets actually hit. All hostages started screaming in pain from someone firing a gun inside a building with no silencer. It was a phenomenon which caused the sound's ricochet to amplify already loud volume of gunshots, especially assault rifles. There was some loud chatter going on between the fighters inside, but Vici couldn't hear what exactly was being said, and she forgot that her bionic ears specifically had a function to separate target incoming information from the noise that blocked it out until it was too late. Thankfully, due to the helmets the duo were wearing having similar properties to bionic ears, neither Victoria nor Brian suffered any serious damage from the sound. 
Victoria kept having the hostage peeking out from behind the door, though eventually he overpowered her and ran through the doorway to start moving around in place erratically, which inside of his mind looked like he was going through a real-life bullet hell as punishment for his also entirely fictional crimes. Brian took the ongoing commotion as a sign everything was going all according to Vici's plan, then he peeked out from his door after counting up to 8 and fired a small rainbow gas gust at each of the two gunmen, then went behind cover to count 8 more seconds. Victoria has decided not to deviate from the plan, assuming Brian would do what was planned, and roughly counted 18 seconds from the moment the screaming started. When Brian peeked out, he was surprised to find one of the terrorists he landed a hit on to be shooting hostages while screaming something, while the other was instead shooting his allies and the ceiling a little before getting put out of his misery by an ally's headshot. Regardless, the plan worked successfully and every single fighter in the room except the handcuffed one Vici used as a human shield was killed without a scratch, minus the fact that pretty much every single hostage's ears were annihilated. Everyone (again, pretty much) laid down in pain with blood pouring out of everyone's ears, and if that wasn't enough, a tied-down lady in a sparkly red dress was killed by a stray gunshot and two more hostages had bullet wounds in them. The surviving terrorist Victoria used as a human shield was completely unbothered by the gruesomeness of it all, continuing to enjoy his rainbow gas trip and spouting psychotic nonsense occasionally. Brian kept an eye out for him. 
"Thank you, gentlemen. Despite all the blood, you've actually done a great job, considering I am completely unharmed. Mind untying me?" - a middle-aged man in a blue bathrobe sitting against a wall requested. He also had a gilded bionic arm stylized in the style of the Infinity Gauntlet and a prosthetic lower jaw, also gilded and covered in gemstones. And if that wasn't enough, he also had bionic LED hair programmed to look golden and glitter. I would list more, but at this point you get the idea. 
Victoria completely ignored the request and went to free the captured Starbloods without saying a word, knowing what would come next would be a little awkward. "Yes, sir." - Brian agreed with the kind of tone he'd use when someone offered him well-seasoned trout and went to obey the request. 
"Shame about Natalia. She gave the best blowjobs." - the man remarked.
Frowning at the implications of the remark, Victoria said nothing and cut the ropes on Lumina with an ice dagger she made on the spot, removing the bag over her eyes and the gag in her mouth. They exchanged an uncomfortable eye contact, trying not to look in eachother's direction and being on guard for the other suddenly attacking. This was also the reason Vici picked to untie Bezdon second, so him being happy to see her would ease the tense atmosphere. When she similarly untied Bezdon and he saw her, he said:
"Vicci? Fuuuuck, I can't believe they sent *you*. This was supposed to be my playground where I could show them I can kick ass. Now the whole mission will be piss easy and unrewarding. Man." - he said with severe disappointment in his voice, plus a subtle undertone of boredom Vici knew Bezdon well enough to detect. As Lumina stood still to face away in emptiness, she felt the exact same thing. 
Victoria sighed. "Help me put on oxygen masks on everyone in the room. Important for the mission." - she said with the same sort of emotionless, flat tone she has not used in a while, handing Bezdon 5 breathing masks. 
"I am happy to see you though, even though the adults robbed me of an opportunity to have some real fun." - he gave her a friendly double tap on the shoulder with a black tentacle sprouting from his back.
"Thanks, likewise." - Victoria felt a little better, though her tone was still flat and morose.
"Why the masks? Do I have to?" - the rich man in a towel asked.
"Unless you have a bionic upper breathing system with an oxygen filter, yea." - Brian said, putting on masks on the hostages at the same time. All Starbloods in the room were busy doinh the same, except Lumina, who felt too weird to help, all the while Vici also felt too awkward to offer her to help too. By now, the hostages without bionic ears have recovered from the immediate pain shock and some even expressed their mental at what happened in strained, meak voices. Then again, even by a few years later none of them would have completely recovered. 
"I do. Still, what are you kids trying to do?"
"A war crime Kaizer Wilhelm the Second would approve. Für Gott, König und Vaterland, motherfucka!" - he exclaimed. 
After the Starbloods were done, Brian entered a side room of the maintenance section from one of the hallways leading to the engine room all the while other Starshards stood and watched. He climbed a table after gently shoving aside a keyboard on it, opened the vent above the table and started breathing rainbow fumes on it. He kept going for a while, infecting the ventilation system of the entire yacht with his acid trip fumes, successfully affecting most of the fighers on the yacht. Brian then descended down and went back outside to the hallway, hyperventilating. "I feel so tired, I don't think I can go on. I think I hit a limit of how much rainbow gas I could produce. The gas should have affected most of the ship, giving you a smooth sailing until the rest of the fighters are cleared out. I'll chill with the hostages. Go." - he said.
"Please check on my fiancé. Make sure she is okay!" - the rich man asked. 
"She's probably delighted, honestly." - Victoria comments. 
"Wait, what do you mean?" 
"Ugh." - her previous line was a failed attempt at implying the fiancé would have loved being separated from the man. Vici decided not to bite the hand that feeds and move on. "You've seen the yacht's blueprints, right, Bez?" - she asked.
"Yep." - Bezdon said, his usual gleeful voice being gone.
"Cool."
When Victoria, Lumina and Bezdon approached the maintenance section door, Lumina turned on her searing hot lightsaber, to which Bezdon had to use one of his void tentacles to gently push her right arm downward a little. "Whoa there, this is a yacht of an Omnislavian magnate. We were told to minimize collateral damage. We can just get it open remotely."
"Uh huh." - Lumina finally said something.
There were two fighters standing outside the door, facing assault rifles at the maintenence door as it was opened remotely by the military. However, when the door opened, the fighterd were shocked by a terrifying sight of Bezdon using each of the four pairs of tentacles he had to hold an assault rifle each, plus another in his hands, with Lumina and Victoria standing near him on opposide sides. 
"He-he-he, howdy." - he said before proceeding to kill all three of them at once with his quintuple-wielded assault rifles. It was clear by the way he held each of them and by how relatively little recoil there was that he had a decent amount of practice with this loadout. In case you're wondering where did he get his rifles, he looted them off of the guys Brian and Victoria killed earlier along with some of their ammo, though Vici assumed it was just loot goblin behavior. 
"I am never doing that again, that was terrifying." - Victoria commented. "Also, holy fuck you've got aura."
"I know, right? Where is she going?" - Bezdon asked in confusion as Lumina used the opportunity to regrow her white wings of light to fly out of the interior. She then curved towards the left while staying near the water and decapitated a terrorist *fix wording* unsuccessfully trying to get her in his sights from near the fence of the yacht's second deck. In the same dash, she turned off the lightsaber, flew up towards a rainbow-eyed guy standing on the yacht's very top and made a mid-air frontflip before pushing him off to the water with a horse-style kick using both of her feet, then hid from the enemy gunfire by hiding on the same roof. At the same time, after hearing the commotion, Victoria and Bezdon ascended to the first deck to take advantage of the disorientation Lumina's maneuver caused to effortlessly kill every fighter in there. Granted, most of them were claimed by Bezdon's guns, but Victoria managed to hit one with a well-aimed ice spear, penetrating his bulletproof vest and miraculously hitting the heart as he was a thirdway into raising his own gun. It was unfortunate for him that "bulletproof" didn't mean "ice spear prooof", though in practice it didn't even mean it was impervious even to bullets either.
When Bezdon and Victoria started ascending to the second topmost deck, Bezdon suddenly said:
"Get down! They're expecting us."
Victoria paused, beginning to assemble a huge greatshield from ice. "How did you even know?"
"My tentacles can see. Or, rather, I can see through them."
"Someone nerf this man, he is too powerful.' - she commented with an inappropriately flat tone as she was focused on preparing the ice shield for a play. When she was finished, she held the shield up and went up the stairs while facing backwards. As expected, her shield was hit by intense gunfire from the 9 enemy gunmen, and as expected, the shield handled it just fine despite minor knockback and shards of it flying to the sides. Enduring the firing squad, Vici stepped forward, shapeshifted an ice ball from the redundant corner of the shield and launched it at an activist via cryokinesis, shattering it mid-air as always. Except this time instead of painful yet non-lethal shards the ball was shattered into a wide spread of sharp bullets, more than enough to kill like a real bullet, though not very good against standard infantry armor. As she repeated the process with others with Bezdon helping a little while staying almost entirely in cover, Lumina capitalized on the commotion by orchestrating a move to slice through three enemies at the same time with a single dash, and while she narrowly missed the first, the other two targets were split in two. She tried to correct her miscalculation after breaking her speed against the floor by shooting the remaining terrorist on the deck with laser eyes, but they unfortunately only had enough firepower to disorient the man from pain of the burns rather than kill. After another attempt to do the same, Victoria's shotgun of doom reached the man and finished him off.
"Bez, come on up before someone comes out of the interior and shoots you." - Vici warned Bezdon.
"That was beautiful. I take it back, this is wonderful." - Bezdon commented as he was going up, high on the euphoria of righteous slaughter.
"Reminds me of how we once fought off 2 full-sized blocks at the same time and won. I won 500 tokens from that, I still remember the fleeting joy."
"This is so much better. In the lab we had to avoid killing and just beat people to pain shock, but now, look at them all and their giant pools of blood! They all had families, parents, ambitions, traits, and we just destroyed them all in a single minute." - Bezdon pointed at Lumina's victims with his right arm. "Look at how Lumina's lightsaber fried these two guys as it cut through them! You could never get anything this cool in the lab." - he kept pointing out, drowning in joy.
"Eh, don't get your obsession with corpses, but I have to admit..." - Vici was interrupted. 
"Would you come on already!? We're not finished yet!" - Lumina finally snapped at the two. 
Meanwhile in the captain's chamber, a teenage girl in a light coat was tied up to a chair. She looked unbothered by her position, and did not try to break free. *give her visual traits matching sofia's* Two fighters stood near the yacht controls with tense body expressions. Both had their faces obscured by full camo helmets.
"Hello? 27, what's the situation with the hostages?" - the one wearing an Order of Suvorov on his chest said with a walkie talkie in his hand. If you're wondering how he obtained one, don't think about it. Thinking is bad for you. 
"Command, this is 27. There were two soldiers trying to recapture the hostages. We ambushed them, one of them is dead, the other has joined the hostages. We're all clear." - the voice answered in a masculine voice. 
"Roger that. Hold your position." - the commander said, turning off the walkie talkie. "So that confirms it. One of the three cleaving through the ship is a freed hostage. We might have lost our only leverage. Any thoughts for the best way for us to surrender? Doesn’t look like there's any way we'll be returning from this." - he commented, facing the other fighter. In case you didn't get what just happened, the voice on the other side was a military spiderbot impersonating a now-dead protestor. The voice wasn't wrong, but the evidence it presented obviously contradicted reality. 
"Alright, that's far enough." - the other fighter with an Order of Lenin on his chest drew his sidearm and shot the commander in the heart 4 times even before he finished the line. He then ripped the Order of Suvorov from his former boss's chest, cleaned it up with a napkin and put it on his own chest. His equipment protected him from the ear damage from the gunfire. 
"Holy shit! You iced him while he was looking right at you. Your so-called childhood best friend! This is crazy, I'm gonna tell all my friends about this once this is over." - the teenage girl commented with an amused grin on her face, unbothered both by 140 decibels of gunfire and the fact that she just witnessed an internal coup happen in front of her.
The new commander finished putting the corpse sitting against a wall and aimed his assault rifle at the girl. "One word to the crew about this and it will be your last."
She shrugged. "I am not a threat to you. I don't have a horse in this race. I just wanna see how this ends. Speaking of, how do you plan on reaching Britain without any hostages to use for blackmailing the military into inaction?"
"You're plenty enough." - the man commander put the rifle behind his back.
"Okay. And what if the 'three superhero dwarves' as you called them reach us here?"
"They won't. There's only three of them, and they're- hmm." - the fighter caught himself before he spoiled the following. 
In the meantime, Victoria, Lumina and Bezdon kept moving through the lavish interior rooms of the yacht and searching for the yacht owner's fiancee. The trio was complete overkill for the threat level, with Bezdon's tentacles being more than enough to do all the work all the while the young ladies stayed behind to watch the flanks. Seeing so many expensive trinkets all around, Victoria really wanted to swipe a few and pawn them, but resisted the inner kleptomaniac. Even if she could "accidentally" turn off the body camera, which she couldn't think of a way to do inconspicuously enough, there was no way a military spy drone wasn't currently watching their every move. Suddenly, after another spree of gunshots Bezdon made an alarmed exhale and hid to the side of an open doorway. Black goo was leaking through one of his tentacles.
"Hello and welcome to your daily OUTMACHED BY DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF RED TALON! Please proceed through the doorway TO GET FILLED WITH BULLETS in an orderly fashion." - a voice from behind the doorway said, using a perfectly human-like feminine voice, occasionally saying some parts of the line in a brutal and masculine voice instead, seamlessly transitioning from one voice to another. All 3 Starbloods were visually alarmed. And yes, the fighter group was called the Red Talon all along.
"You heard that, right?" - Bezdon asked Vici with unusual tension in his voice, even if he kept the usual composure.
"Yup." - she replied, her internal tension skyrocketing. This just went from an average risk operation to a matter of life and death. "It had to happen eventually."
"We advise you to find another way in or leave the mission. Our intel suggested nothing about androids." - the Starbloods heard an unknown, clearly military-affiliated masculine voice say to their ears through their equipment. 
"Not so tough now, are you, child Solid Snake wannabes? If you think I am punished for killing children on the battlefield, let me enlighten you: WE GET TWICE THE DOPAMINE FOR KILLING CHILDREN." - the android in the room taunted them, saying the first sentence with a cheery masculine narrator voice, the first half of second with the feminine voice from earlier and the second half with something an evil overlord video game final boss would have. And yes, any non-primitive AI has reward and punishment systems, just like a human brain, and no, it's generally a very bad idea to let them have any control whatsoever over these systems. Unsurprisingly, the taunt backfired by making Bezdon smile gleefully in response instead, and the girls didn't react at all. 
"Ignore its taunting. There is no shame in fleeing a fight you can't win unless we specifically tell you otherwise." - the military-affiliated voice continued. It might not have done much now, but this strategy was disproportionately effective considering pretty much anyone even remotely familiar with modern warfare was well aware of it. 
"Let's see if the unwinnable part is true." - Vici said, constructing something big from ice in preparation for a move. 
Bezdon used the opportunity to peek out with his gun and try to kill the android, but Vici's earlier description of combat androids was not an overexagerration, and as soon as the tentacles peeked out, the high-caliber bullets of the android's gun flung the assault rifle in Bezdon's tentacles into the corner and caused more goo to pour out of his tentacles. He still had 5 tentacles and 3 assault rifles undamaged, though. "That was dumb." - he commented, remembering that android reaction speed was way better than what any human could muster. He then showed Vici a gesture of crossed pinky and ringfinger, indicating that he is about to say something knowingly false to disorient the enemy with verbal disinformation presented as real tactical discussion. "So how do we even run away? We might be pinned down here." - he had no idea what exactly was her plan or how high were her chances of survival, but he knew she was way better at quick tactical thinking than any human he knew, and he knew she wasn't the kinda person to sacrifice herself in battle. Lumina just stood to the side, unable (and partly unwilling) to add anything, focusing on monitoring the corridors for reinforcements.
"I say we throw a smoke bomb and hope for the best. We're fucked." - Victoria replied, also showing the pinky and ringfinger crossed gesture for a moment while preparing two ice greatshields. She knew that an NCAI, which felt no pain and was made of metal, couldn't be defeated with ice shards, and even an ice spear would have barely made a dent. And yet, she did do her homework for this exact situation. "Command, how many androids are there in the next room?" - she whispered.
"One." - the same voice from earlier replied through her's equipment.
"If I die, tell the gang I died happily." - Victoria said before sprinting through the doorway while holding up two thick ice greatshields. The android attempted to shoot at the bottom to hit her legs, but failed to penetrate it, allowing her to get close to the robot, sandwich it between the ice shields and shapeshift the ice from the shields into a proper ice shell to encase the android in it, rendering it functionally inact. She considered melting the inside of the ice shell to fry the android's circuits with water (assuming it wasn't waterproofed), but felt like the military would have appreciated a recaptured android in mint condition. The android tried to say something, but only distorted noises of wildly varying pitch and volume were audible. Victoria beckoned Bezdon to come in, who in turn gestured Lumina to follow him. 
"Fight you can't win my ass. Adults are way too careful, man, this is easy." - he commented, giving his arms a little adrenalized shake.
"It's still androids. Can't say much with this guy still alive and listening, but they're AGI's. The next one will expect this as our move, unless this one lacks even the basic android to android communication, and it doesn't look like it." - Victoria rounded up the android's ice shell to take the most obviously excessive parts of it back, avoiding taking too much to prevent the android from suddenly breaking free and killing all 3 operatives, and constructed thick front-only leg armor from the salvaged ice. She couldn't say it outloud, but her ice supply was two thirds to depletion, and another ice sandwich trick like that would have left her with barely enough to defend herself against humans. She also tried to find a large water bottle or sink nearby to refill her ice reserves, but all she could find was wine and vodka. It still helped refill the supply by ~5%.

*the scene where the big bad guy is confronted but vici dips*







*when adults lie to vici* "You're either telling the truth, or you're the world's best liar." 












One evening, while Adrian was staying up late to track down and arrest a local man who took a book from a library without paying, Vici was at home, preparing snacks to watch revisionist history documentaries all on her own. When passing by Kate who was typing something with a frustrated expression, Vici offered her:

"Hey, want some dried apples? Heard-" - that they were your favorite, she wanted to say.

"No! I'm busy!" - Kate replied with intense frustration in her voice. It wasn't very common she was seen in a state like this.

"Just asking. Jeez, isn't the whole privilege of being a Starshard or even just a police intern that you get an unlimited supply of people to unleash your repressed anger on?" - Victoria started walking away.

"Sorry, sorry. Thought you were my pa. Just… having an argument online."

"Oh shit? Kate the keyboard warrior? What's up, what's going on?" - Vici quickly turned back towards Kate and quickly laid next to her to see what she was busy with.

"It's been a long conversation, there's a lot to keep track…" - Kate put down her phone and faced Victoria. "But he, okay. This guy said all cyborgs are evil and are abominations to God. Fucking why? Why would anyone ever think that? Does he not fucking realize people lose limbs in war and that they need bionics to not be fucking legless? HAS HE NOT HEARD THE SONGS AMPUTEES WRITE ABOUT THEIR LIVES? Or-or-or, or you know, people like you have sensitive ears and therefore need bionics to not die of earbleed every time there's a slightly louder than normal sound?" - Kate's tone and hand movements have been getting progressively more aggressive with time. "And when I tell him that, send him that one ancient song about a cyborg ninja who lost his legs and how all he feels is phantom pain, he just doesn't care. I mean, he says that the word of God is absolute and that he makes no exceptions. Like, what-what the fuck? \*How\* are people like that are allowed to walk the streets and not be chained and caged like the most animalistic of animals? W-w-w…" - Kate made one final exhausted exhale and shrugged quickly.

Vici's excitement about the conversation faded halfway through the rant, and she started giving the turned-off TV in the distance with half-emptiness, half-sadness. "Wow. There is \*definitely\* a problem here."

"Yes!" - Kate said so loudly that the auto-muter in Victoria's bionic ears was forced to activate for a moment to round up the volume spike. "I just don't understand how someone can look truth and logic in the eye and spit in them."

"No… Well, yea, I agree, but I feel like there's a different problem here. You see some stupid corpsebile online who argues a position that uses circular logic, high heels and stereotyping to justify their own prejudice, and you tell yourself, 'Target locked'. They become a target of your wrath. You gotta let it go sometimes, you know." - Victoria explained it with mildly audible sadness.

"Why is that a problem, though? I am a servant of the law, as nasty as it can be sometimes, it's… These people represent the prejudiced elements of the ages long gone and they need to be alienated for society to progress. It's shit like that which caused the segregation and the pogroms and the Holocaust and the Terkish genocide of Chinese ethnic minorities." - Kate spoke very fast, faster than usual. No, you read that last part right, she did not mean it the other way around.

"Yea, it's true, but that's not what I'm saying. You did this with the one who claimed muslims are born without a soul, the one who disagreed with you over duels being allowed again, the muslim who said you should be stoned to death for doing something other than cooking and cleaning, the gal who said her inferior female hormones made her stupid or whatever. How many more before it's enough? If these people are so ridiculous and stupid, why are you giving them your resources? Why are you taking them seriously? If these corpsebiles really are the kind of backwards savages we're raised to see as a negative example, why do they deserve your attention? I can see from the outside view how much energy you're wasting on them, and, is it really worth it? Are they worth it?" - Victoria faced Kate, trying to make the most reasonable and convincing expression she could muster. She felt like that required a light smile, but she also didn't feel like smiling.

Kate looked away for a second. "...I don't know… but if I won't do something about it, who will? All everyone does is ignore how many of these corpsebiles are in all corners of society and enable them and their behavior, and… I just don't know what I can do." - she admitted sadly.

"Not waste your energy trying to dissuade one, that's for sure. Have you ever successfully managed to convince your opponent in a political discussion to change their side to yours?" - a 5 second long silence dawned. Vici nodded. "Exactly." - she then laid back and faced the ceiling. "Truth is, I also don't know what we can do about this. Right now though, there's nothing. We're just cyanobacteria on a seashell we call Earth at the bottom of an ocean we call the universe. The only way to gain power here is to curbstomp others and their hopes and dreams. And that's what we're raised to do. As Starshards."

"I wanna believe you're wrong. I wanna hope there is something we can do about how shit everything is. I want a calmer world where draconian treatment isn't the norm and considering others' feelings is. And I can't give up striving for that goal." - Kate made a fist with her right hand and stared at it.

"It's your call. I already know we can't fully understand eachother's idealism and nihilism. Not much point arguing much about it." - Vici shrugged emotionlessly. It wasn't an opinion she consistently held regardless of mood: sometimes she was actually in the mood to do exactly that simply because it was fun.

"That we can agree on." - the same could be said about Kate. "I just realized something… You said, I quote, you gotta just let it go sometimes. Don't take this as a jeer \*verify wording\*, but does that mean our old teacher is off your hit list?"

Vici sighed. "I don't know. No, probably. You're right to point out the irony. But it doesn't bother me as much anymore. Everything is looking up for me, my life is improving, and my emotional state with it." - Victoria replied emptily.

Weapon usage:

Lasers: best choice against drones and unarmored missiles, too expensive against pretty much everything else

Plasma weapons: really expensive and impractical, reserved only for the rich

Railguns: great with supersoldier units and tanks and often paired with explosives, possible for infantry or civilian self defense but not cheap enough to be practical, also used for lighter AA protection

Flamethrowers: good for close quarters when collateral damage isn't a factor (very rare)

Modern ballistic pneumatic guns: police and civilian self defense

Anti materiel guns: best choice for infantry cannon fodder and standard androids

Gas weapons: used to drive up the costs of warfare for the enemy rather than as a genuine weapon

Flameblades: tons of mini flamethrowers on a durable blade. Designed for cyborg ninjas as an anti android measure

Counterparts of the military:

Fist of Liberty Branch (direct conventional warfare; encompasses ground forces, navy, AF, space warfare, drones and missiles)

Eye of Liberty Branch (external intelligence, spying, sabotage, assasinations, basically cia)

Mind of Liberty Branch (research, inventions, experiments, bioweapons and secretly nukes)
