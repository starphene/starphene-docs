Project Town Game

Plans:

Time machine
Add time machine which allows fast forwarding time right from the get go. Each ad gives access to it for 60 seconds, plus you get 60s freebie. Time outside the game gives you a small amount of access to it with logarithmically more gains from more time, but if the game detects you’re cheating (the clock time remains the same but the day changes, long term delays don’t differ enough, too much time is skipped) it silently and gently reduces timescumming effectiveness (to ~50% after 10 times) until a cap. You get infinite access to it with premium. Non-premium decelerates pace faster and silently

The disease system 
Would be communicated clearly. The herbs will take disproportionately much resources to gather but diseases will be rare and the storage limits would be generous, requiring you to produce and stockpile herbs to avoid consequences. There would be random events which would force the player into choices into wasting large chunks of their supply to get sweet bonuses or to get nothing. Failure to address the issue will either amount to severely capped population loss (33% maybe) and/or make recovery fast and artificially supported, plus there would generally be productivity efficiency decrease while population is recovering. There would be a pretty wide variety of diseases with some having interesting effects like forcefully aging or deaging the population. As the game progresses, so would diseases, but required older medicine won’t be as effective on them anymore.

Random events 
Similar model to after inc, nothing to explain

Collectibles and relics
Collectibles are hidden in various layers of UI (or gameplay) and reward relics for collecting them all. Relics are permanent buffs which accumulate value with age and can be sold for gold or platinum. 

Food
Starts as a basic resource before branching out into different types of nutrients, incentivizing varied production. Feeding the population all available types of food would give productivity buffs. Starvation cascades will be made way milder by an ability to turn on rationing mode and prioritize abandoning food production last in case of depopulation (it’d also be a whole system configurable by the player). Likewise, there would be an option to increase consumption to grow population faster unlockable with the tech tree. Industrial age would introduce happiness loss from unemployment.

Happiness
High value boosts birth rates and productivity, low value plunges productivity and explorer/warrior efficiency, negative value activates discord mode and causes people to leave. Maintained by taking care of the population. Eventually buildings are added to help it. Progression forces player to do more to maintain it. Would be split into a volatile value directly influenced by bonuses/demerits, the actual value which would approach the volatile one, and the approach speed (delta) dictated by discord/fatigue values and possibly a few external buffs.

Discord mode and crisis fatigue (bar)
Activates when happiness or city security plummets too far into the negatives, and is stopped when volatile happiness/security is restored to 60%, with lower cancelation thresholds the longer discord mode lasts. Aimed at preventing crises from being too punishing. Has an orange mode (discord mode) and a red mode (chaos mode? Super discord mode?), both of which add color specific elements to UI to show tension without GTA online loss streak bullshit. Orange mode can turn into red, but not the other way around. Orange freezes happiness delta by 50% and red freezes it completely, both give bonuses to productivity and reduce security resource cost (and even more so to combat efficiency) but red gives more. Crisis fatigue is a bar which drains during discord, with red discord draining it 2.5x faster (entering both orange and red discord gives a deduction from crisis fatigue every time it's triggered). If the bar runs out, it can go into negatives up to a certain point (-25%), and that would cause the compensatory buffs to gradually recede over time until they hit zero, but that would be reasonably rare and mostly aimed at nudging the player against abusing combat benefits. Crisis fatigue has a large pool and is recovered faster the better is happiness, but recovers very very slowly as a baseline.

Population and housing
Bottlenecks how much production can be active in production and how much rare public servant/fighter candidates are there. Housing increases max population. If max pop < current pop, people slowly leave. This is modified with latter research, allowing population growth above max, but with worsening happiness debuffs. Early-mid game will introduce different types of housing with different advantages for the player to pick.
Stored in the memory as kids/working age/starting to age/too old to work.

Resources
Wood (buildings)
Stone (buildings, other resources)
Fur (building material, used for armor, later tech tree upgrade to remove it from the game)
Energy (can be allocated to empower production of certain buildings multiplicatively)
Food (needed to sustain population growth and happiness, can be rationed in times of crisis or allowed overconsumption of to boost birth rates)
Elite food (can be eaten to restore energy, also used by combatants and public servants to grow their happiness)
Energy (used to boost certain buildings' productivity)
Sugars (increase population loyalty)
Security (small volume, restores quickly, used to prevent minor incidental resource/people loss and is consumed during some random events. Restores progressively slower when in the negatives and triggers discord mode when too far in the negatives)
Copper (used for weapons, armor and jewelry, and later electronics, can later be transmuted from stone)
Gold (used as a currency, for jewelry and to enhance weapons and armor)
Gems (for jewelry and to enhance weapons and armor)
Iron (used for weapons and armor)
Silver (used for weapons, armor, jewelry, and yes it’s above gold somehow)
Platinum (ultra currency for special deals and panic buttons)
Gunpowder (powers weapons and some buildings)
Oil (medicine, energy, happiness buildings, later weapons, armor and space travel)
Aliminium (used for weapons, armor)
Isotopes (energy, space travel and later mechanoids)
Magnetogens (combines rare earth magnetogens, powers weapons, armor and mechanoids)
Plasteel (powers ai age tier buildings and mechanoiods)
Efferprism (powers supreme mechanoids and space travel)

Tech tree
It will be huge and awesome. Will include:
New buildings
New manual gathering actions
Passive bonuses 
New mechanics
Allowing pop growth past max, adding homelessness
Allowing rationing to survive crisees
Allowing overeating to accelerate birth rates (two tiers)
Lowers the minimum working age but decreases happiness
Lowers the maximum working age but decreases happiness
Would have an option to branch into ruling with an iron fist to minimize worrying about happiness through maintaining discord mode, ruling with consideration of the people’s needs and maximizing happiness, and ruling neglectfully to maximize profits through ignoring happiness
Will be accessible through pulling up the swipe left menu. The background would be an image of a starry sky, and on it would be a long chain of nodes symmetrical around the y axis going from bottom upwards. The node manager would generate each node according to my incoming info about each node, and each connected node would have an white or green arrow connecting them in case of requirements (the color depends on if the requirement is met). The nodes would be pretty minimalistic in design with a type of gain from the node on the icon, and the border indicating whenever it's complete or not. Tapping on any node would pull up a popup with its description with all its relevant information, and have a button which unlocks the node's effects when held up for 1.5 seconds. 



Actual tech tree: (keep this line started at a decimal-1 number to calculate order better; buff nodes are visually smaller)
(Stage 1 start) Unlock building: living hut (base pop building), also gives a popup to explain the population/housing mechanic //Unlock living huts:  Let's teach them how to make rudimentary housing. Of course, we could teach them how to make proper, nature-resistent housing right away, but I think you'll agree it'd be more fun for them to discover that technology on their own. 
Buff: manually picking wood, food or stone produces 2/3/4 times of it multiplicatively (not per upgrade, the final tier is only 4x the base) //Effective Gathering: There's potential to use some spare clothes to improvise a bag, amplifying gathering efficiency. 
Buff: manually picking any resource adds a different resource to the stockpiles every second time (fix wording), sometimes including furs and herbs if they're unlocked (previous upgrade must be at tier 3 to unlock) //Multi-gathering: Sometimes looking for one resource can present an opportunity to grab something else without significantly hurting carrying capacity.
Unlock building: forager's hut (auto food gathering) //Unlock forager's huts: There's no need to keep manually sourcing food for our villagers. It's not a complicated form of skilled labor, we can teach them how to source it themselves. 
Unlock building: logger's hut (auto wood gathering) //Unlock logger's huts: While it's complicated without proper tools, we can still teach them to gather wood. It's far from impossible.
Unlock building: stonepicker's hut (auto stone gathering) //Unlock living huts: Preparing workers would only need one lecture about the optimal sizes of rocks and where to find them. Nothing to break your own back over.
Unlock building: stockpile hut (increase storage size for most resources) //Protecting the resource we've gathered from nature's elements is very important. Even if the protection is... shoddy.
Buff: reduce housing building construction costs by 20% per level (*) and increase their population capacity bonus by 10% per level (+), 3 levels //Building Improvements: Someone suggested a way to make housing cheaper and with better capacity. Part of the reason why I thought it would be fun to start with antique huts. 
Unlock action: Gather Herbs (tier 1 medicine), also gives a popup to explain the disease mechanic //Unlock gathering herbs: The sickness is draining the villagers of their resources. Thankfully, it seems there's the perfect kind of herbal medicine growing only a kilometer to the north.
Unlock building: Healer's hut (picks herbs OR heals population) //Unlock healers' huts: Will allow the villagers to manage herb foraging and healing on their own. It's not always something a child could do, but it's not bioengineering either.
Buff: Slowly consumes herbs but increases global productivity by 10%, can be toggled off (*) //Herbal self-medication: There's a lot of good you can do with these herbs alone even outside severe sickness. A lot of bad, too, so we better teach them the specifics if you want to allow them to use it for minor wounds. 
Buff: Slowly consumes more herbs but increases population growth by 20% (*) //Herbal health: It seems the villagers have figured out how to apply the herbs for general health. Probably worth looking into.
Unlock building: hunter's hut (auto food and more of it, auto furs) //Unlock hunters' huts: Hunting is way harder than foraging: berries aren't exactly known for running away from you. That said, some of the villagers know the basics already, so we have a headstart. 
Unlock building: researcher's hut (reduces research resource cost) //Unlock researchers' huts: It's primitive and there are little ways to access information or education, but it would help speed things along.
Buff: food production buildings produce 5/10/15% more food for 5/10/15% less work (all multiplicatively) //Effective Foraging: Some of the foragers have learnt a more efficient way to do their jobs. What if all of them did?
Buff: stone production buildings produce stone 10/20/30% faster and increase max stone storage by (flat X) each (all multiplicatively) //Effective Stonepicking: A stonepicker has discovered a technique to carry huge rocks and smash them into smaller ones as needed. There's potential to optimize the shattering process and share that wisdom. 
Buff: wood production buildings take 5/10/15% more work produce wood 20/40/60% faster. //Effective Logging: Seems like the process of logging wasn't so hard after all. The process is very physically demanding, though.
Buff: stockpile buildings are now 15/30/45% cheaper to build (multiplicatively) //Effective Stockpiling: The stockpile buildings don't seem to need this much finesse or polish to do their function. 
Buff: manually picking anything has a 10% chance to double/triple/quadruple the yield //Lucky Gathering: Sometimes gathering really goes in your favor.
Buff: bonuses from research improving buildings are now 15/30/45% higher, but they now require 20/40/60% more work (all multiplicatively) //Sparkling Minds: The researchers are going all out on it. 
Buff: completing any research node grants 25% increase to production and consumption of buildings for 30 seconds but does not affect the work cost (multiplicatively) //Progress Inspiration: Modifying our framing of our accomplishments would do a lot for the morale.
Buff: hunter's huts now produce 50%/100%/200% more fur (+) and are now 10%/20%/30% cheaper to build (multiplicatively) // Effective Hunting: Taking less throwing spears to kill big animals and other ways to improve hunting efficiency could allow a much better gain of furs. They're very useful. 
Unlock action: Rationing mode (halves food consumption when turned on and reduces birthrates multiplicatively by 3. However, activating it outside of a crisis will trigger one, making the population pretty unhappy), also gives a popup to explain discord mode // Unlock Rationing Mode: If something happens to our food, this will be very good at preserving whatever would be left of it. The villagers would hate it, though, and parenthood would become insurmountable.
Buff: Crisis fatigue recovers 50/100/150% faster multiplicatively. //Crisis tolerance: The villagers have started to recover from the early days of the settlement. With time, they will be plenty well-equipped to handle a crisis.
Unlock building: Chieftain's cabin (player's home, unlocks energy, allowing you to allocate it to empower certain buildings' production) //Unlock Chieftain's cabin: Your new, enormous home. The increased comfort would allow you to help the settlement in a new kind of way.
Buff: manually picking wood, food or stone produces +50/100/150% of it (+) //Advanced Gathering: Reinvention of the wheel now allows you to haul a way greater haul homeward. 
Buff: manually picking wood, food or stone 10 times within a small timeframe empowers production of a corresponding building type by 10% (*) for 15/30 seconds //Inspiring Gathering: A few villagers already feel more inspired by your direct assistance in resource gathering. That effect can be amplified.
Unlock building: Villager's cabin (way more efficient housing) //Unlock Villagers' Cabin: We have rediscovered knowledge for building homes which don't crumble from strong wind. Making a template for villager housing first seems reasonable, we should instantly notice an improvement.
Unlock building: Hunter's cabin (auto food, auto furs, way faster and more efficient than huts) //Unlock Hunter's Cabin:
Unlock building: Farm (auto food in enormous amounts, possibly 4x forager hut's output)
Unlock building: Logger's cabin (auto wood, way more efficient production)
Buff: not empowering with energy, building or reallocating workers for a building type for 1/3/10 minutes improves its production by 5/10/15% (*) but does not affect the work cost or consumption 
Unlock action: Overexertion (consumes all energy to buff all production and consumption with no work cost increase for 30 seconds by 2x the amount the buff at the softcap value (the growth of production/consumption buff depending on energy allocation would be linear before starting to decelerate at a certain point), but would disable any energy bonuses for 60 second afterwards. This has a 5 minute cooldown)
Buff: Overexertion lasts a third longer (*) and its cooldown takes 80% as much time (*) by a to wear off
Buff: Overexertion fatigue lasts 50% longer (*) and cooldown lasts 25% longer (*) but overexertion gives 3x the buff at the softcap value
Buff: each unlocked tech tree node gives +0.25% (+) global production and consumption, capped at +30%
Unlock building: Lecture cabin (way better research resource cost reduction, each cabin also empowers all production speed by 5% additively)
Unlock building: Mine (way faster stone production)
(Stage 2 start) Unlock action: Dungeon crawling, diablo style itemization for candidates for exploration and their equipment, also unlocks dungeon Slimy mines (from enough stuff produced from the mines, also meeting the milestone requirement for this tanks output of mines by 30% until the dungeon is cleared;)(initially dungeon crawling only allows 2 party members and only a few classes but the mechanical foundation is already being set here. The dungeon is a literal straight line until halfway through it splits into two directions. Each direction leads to a miniboss, and each miniboss cell would have a one way path back to the crossroad. Killing any of the minibosses turns the other one into the dungeon boss)
 Unlock action: Crafting (weapons and armor, they're a lot tamer and harder to hit an item with rarities above normal but can be good to make up for underleveled gear)
Unlock building: Altar (buffs explorers and increases happiness)
Unlock action: can allow explorers to fully self-manage by picking choices randomly 
Unlock action: when allowing explorers to fully self-manage you get options to make them prioritize loot, progress or map clarity
Unlock action: explorers note down the cells they visited before, noting them on a map accessible  to the player
Buff: explorers getting full healed increases their max hp by 5/10/15% for the duration of the run and now have this increase incremented by other buffs
Buff: 5/10/15% chance to deal critical damage, and buffs can now improve this chance or allow each crit to crit in square
Unlock building: Builder's Guild (Reduces building costs multiplicatively, exceptions include itself and upgrades, maybe more)
Unlock action: mirrored infinity (defeating the dungeon's boss punches a new path in a random wall which allows entrance to the mirrored infinity. it allows the explorers to explore an infinite mirror of the greater dungeon which increases in difficulty linearly and in rewards in square as the party progresses further)
Buff: 15/30/50% (*) more likely to encounter a treasure cell in Mirrored Infinity
Buff: Mirrored infinity loot scales in cube instea d of square
Unlock dungeon: Tolkien-Derivative Caverns (all enemies are tolkien derivatives like goblins, orcs and ents slightly lazily renamed to golbins, orkers and trents, there's also a lazy eye of sauron rename as a miniboss and just the roaring knight. his dungeon in particular is shaped like 4 layers of wheels with each layer being connected to the adjasent layers with the entrance being located at random, it would require killing any of the 2 eyes of sauron located randomly at on the outer layer to unlock the boss in the middle, killing the boss unlocks gold as a resource, at around this point in the game relics are discovered and introduced though you can't really sell them yet) 
Buff: you can now have 3 party members (locked behind killing an eye of sauron derivative)
Buff: 15% chance to not consume any medicine when the party is defeated, and this increase is incremented by other buffs
Buff: 10% chance to negate all received damage onto the enemy dealing it, and this increase is incremented by other buffs
Buff: 5% chance to reflect all received damage onto the enemy dealing it, and this increase is incremented by other buffs
Unlock building: Smelting Pit (consumes wood and copper ore to smelt copper bars)
Unlock building: fisherman's house (auto food and occasional treasure)

Electricity
Produced by power plants, powers pretty much every building starting from industrial era

Energy, manual work and rallying workers
The player has a pool of energy which restores quickly but has a small max amount, allowing to assist in production. At some point this gets replaced with the player being given options to automatically enchant certain buildings’ production after the town gets too big. You can spec into maximinning or minmaxing the bonus from this effect.

Story: The player is an immortal vampire. They have an enigmatic, obedient councilor who basically does everything for them. 

Dungeon crawling
Similar model to magic research, has resources which are originally exclusively obtained from there but later gain a way to produce them with a building. Dungeons also often pose an active threat and occasionally generate negative random events before they’re cleared out and cease posing a threat. There are several possible classes with specific synergies between one another. Each class has separate skills, strengths, weaknesses, and equipment needed. I’ll try to make manual combat interesting through some fun, redoable puzzle the player would have to solve. Equipment has deep itemization and is gathered through finding it or crafting it.
The dungeon crawling system which would be designed around a procedually generated grid of cells, with latter dungeons having more complex shapes and mechanics. Each cell would give the player a fight, a shop using a dungeon-only currency, a full heal, a loot chest and possibly a few other possible effects. After clearing out a cell the player be forced into a choice where to go after most of the battles, and the game will automatically map what the player has explored. The entire sent out party dying will send all collected items and keep all the progress on changing or exploring cells but will deduct a maintenance cost from the resources before the party is allowed to continue. Each dungeon has a specific way to reach the boss, and killing the boss would give the player an additional extra reward and possibly unlock the next dungeon in the list. The combat itself would probably be entirely strategy and equipment based with little player input on the fight outcome after that. There would also be an option to delegate all the decision making to the party which would explore the dungeon autonomously based on the player-set priorities of progress or loot. 
Several classes to pick (i am thinking to scale it from 3 starting ones to 6-8 in the late game before the system is gradually replaced with a different one) from any allocation of which could be allowed for the party except for when the same class is used more than 2 times. The player would have zero control over the tactical side and the combat itself would be entirely handled by reasonably but not expensively advanced AI's (something robust enough handle angry birds epic unlike the autoplay in that game, i am thinking to make it track the level of tactical harm by each individual enemy and note it down so they can choose which targets to prioritize, plus be able to hold off using an ultra skill until a party member of the best benefit would be available to use it), but they would be able to make a decision for the party where to go when there is a fork in the dungeon aswell as control the party's classes (any person could technically choose any class but applicability would vary depending on each explorer's aptitudes all of which would be BL style deep itemized), skill choices and equipment (which would be BL style deep itemized). With progression, the player would get a choice to change each of the main/secondary/ultra skill to one of the options which unlock with progression, with growth being both in width and height (so the player can make a strategic choice to use a different skill for an applicable slot to deal with a different kind of obstacle).

Classes (each has a pick for primary, secondary, passive and ultra): 
Commander (primary skill to do melee damage in one or two attacks, secondary skill to buff all allies)
Cleric (primary skill to heal and possibly buff, secondary skill to curse enemies)
Bulwark (primary skill to hit and taunt an enemy, secondary skill to protect allies)
Marksman (primary skill to do high damage charged attacks, secondary skill to taunt or use visibility buffs to manipulate chances of enemies targeting a specific party member) (unlocked in bronze age)
Rogue (primary skill to hit enemies with DOT, secondary skill to buff a single target) (unlocked in steel age)
Sorcerer (primary skill to do high AOE damage, secondary skill to penetrate enemy defenses) (unlocked in magic age)
Druid (primary skill to heal, secondary skill to cleanse buffs or debuffs) (unlocked in silver age)

gets extra benefits from max health increases, max health after heal, defense, buff duration length
gets extra benefits from healing strength, buff duration length, debuff duration length and something else

Cell types:
Enemy (gray) 
Shop (blue) 
Full heal (green)
Loot (yellow, turns into enemy cell after you take the loot) 
Gray with red outline (switch required to unlock boss guarded by an enemy) 
Red (boss) 
Purple (door to mirroring infinity, a place where the party can explore an infinite procedually generated subdungeon for loot, though the amount of loot and shop cells is considerably smaller there but it increases in square as you progress and progressing far enough can give you a relic)




Public servants (have rarity tiers, give different bonuses depending on the exact type. Have their own happiness which tanks their bonuses which is affected by the salary and access to premium commodities. However, they get used to having these mood boosts which moves the bar for them upwards (but the distance between standards and actual satisfaction requirement still slowly increases so the player doesn't feel as cheated by upgrading their accommodations), and if the level of accomodation drops below their bar the productivity tanks and they need 3 times as long to lower the bar than they need to rise it. Might also make the growth pattern toward target bar distance hyperbolic (or x^-0.5) so waiting always brings benefits) Dungeon crawling (need employees and gear for them, used to clear out threats to the city when they appear and regular dungeons which can be explored for resources, loot, etc etc. Employees, their gear, and enemies have difficulty tiers. Might make a cool minigame for manual combat) Artists (convert specific groups of resources into art pieces which can be sold or treasured depending on the quality) Trade routes (ability to make planned exchanges of overproduced shit for underproduced shit, but being unable to make a preordained purchase damages trust and temporarily reduces the amount of shit you can order in advance. Population + average happiness affects) Rarity (every resident has a rarity category in each of the possible skillsets which goes from gray (weak) - white (common) - green (uncommon) - teal (lucky) - blue (rare) - yellow (extraordinary ) - orange (unique) - red (legendary) - purple (mythical) - rainbow (supreme). All residents have a random age where their skills plummet due to old age and another one where they die, with yhe player being able to upgrade life expectancy. As population grows, access to higher rarities becomes more available, but occasionally it's possible to get a rarity 2 tiers above normal. Residents of tiers way below progression norm are not displayed to save performance. The rng allocation is specifically built so a lot of amazing residents have several aptitudes where they're amazing to force the player into difficult choices. It's possible to buy high-tier residents if you get lucky and if you give them enough of an entry bonus, but they're also way more sensitive to bad treatment and can even leave. Gear also has the same rarities) Tech tree (requires specific buildings and workers for it and handles lots of unlocks, is gated by progress in other areas)
